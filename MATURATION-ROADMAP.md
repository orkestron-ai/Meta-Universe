# Meta-Universe — Specification Maturation Roadmap

**Working document — NOT part of the normative specification.**
This is the internal plan for taking Meta-Universe v2 from *Working Draft* to a
mature, implementable, citable standard. It is distinct from the product-facing
[Roadmap](06-ecosystem/Roadmap.md): that one describes where the ecosystem is
going; this one describes how the *specification itself* is finished and hardened.

Status: Draft · Owner: Orkestron.AI · Consolidates two independent critical
reviews (internal "Self" review + Grok review, June 2026).

---

## 1. Current maturity scorecard

| Dimension | Now | Target (mature) |
|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| Conceptual maturity | 8.5–9 / 10 | keep |
| Specification maturity (precision, no ambiguity) | 6–6.5 / 10 | 8.5+ |
| Practical / tooling maturity (examples, validation, implementability) | 5–5.5 / 10 | 8+ |
| Adoption & tooling readiness | 5 / 10 | 8+ |
| **Overall** | **~6.8–7.2 / 10** | **8.5+** |

**Diagnosis (both reviews agree):** the conceptual skeleton and the values are
strong; the gap is **formalization and executable artifacts**. Without them the
spec remains "beautiful philosophy" rather than something that can be
implemented, validated and relied upon during federation.

---

## 2. Where the two reviews converge (and what each added)

| Theme | Self | Grok | Verdict |
|-------|:----:|:----:|---------|
| Formal core + canonical serialization + reproducible Semantic Fingerprint | ✅ | ✅ | **Keystone** |
| MUFP is "a protocol" in name only (no messages/states/errors) | ✅ | ✅ | Critical |
| Validation/Conformance not testable / not reproducible | ✅ | ✅ | Critical |
| No executable examples / reference meta-models | ✅ | ✅ | Critical |
| Security & privacy / threat model thin | ✅ | ✅ | Critical |
| Demonstrate (not assert) interop with RDF/FHIR/Schema.org | ✅ | ➖ | Important |
| Identifier scheme + CSN grammar | ✅ | ➖ | Important |
| Governance operational + IPR/patent policy + repo hygiene | ✅ | ➖ | Important |
| Executable Discovery + machine-readable spec index | ✅ | ➖ | Important |
| Core Profile / MVP conformance | ✅ | ➖ | Important |
| Canonical diagrams + MUDL | ✅ | ✅ | Important |
| v1.1 continuity (M1–M4 layers dropped) | ✅ | ➖ | Important |
| Status-of-document banners | ✅ | ➖ | Polish |
| **MU Interchange Format (MUIF) as a named artifact** | ➖ | ✅ | Adopted |
| **Semantic Test Kit + golden files** | ➖ | ✅ | Adopted |
| **Semantic Coherence Score (graded certification)** | ➖ | ✅ | Adopted |
| **Queryable Provenance Graph ("what breaks if X changes")** | ➖ | ✅ | Adopted |
| **Decentralized Registry on DID + Verifiable Credentials** | ➖ | ✅ | Adopted |
| **Minimal reference CLI (mu-validate / mu-fingerprint / mu-diff)** | ➖ | ✅ | Adopted |
| **De-duplication / single-source shared sections; merge Best-Practices↔Design-Recommendations** | ➖ | ✅ | Adopted |
| **i18n / multilingual model** | ➖ | ✅ | Adopted |

## 3. Guiding principles for the maturation pass

1. **Formalization first.** Every abstract claim must acquire a concrete,
   testable face (schema, grammar, message, test, or example).
2. **MUIF is the keystone.** Fingerprint, Validation, Migration, tooling and
   examples all depend on a canonical interchange format. It is built first.
3. **Every normative `SHALL` gets a stable Requirement ID** so it can be cited,
   validated and tested mechanically.
4. **Nothing is "done" without an executable artifact** (a file in `examples/`,
   `schemas/`, or `tests/`), not only prose.
5. **Preserve the concepts that reviewers praised** (Event/Semantic Timeline,
   Projection-not-Copy, Identity Agreement, Composition Hierarchy, Federation of
   Registries, Anti-Patterns). Maturation hardens them; it does not rewrite them.

---

## 4. The roadmap

Workstreams are grouped into three phases. Each lists: **Source** (Self / Grok /
Both), **Deliverables** (concrete files), **Acceptance criteria**, **Depends on**.

### Phase 1 — v2.1 "Make it implementable" (Critical)

#### WS1 — MUIF: Meta-Universe Interchange Format  · Source: Grok (+Self)
The canonical machine-readable face of the abstract model — the keystone.
- **Deliverables:** `02-architecture/MMAS-Interchange.md`; `schemas/` with JSON
  Schema for `Meta-Model`, `Object`, `Relationship`, `Event`, `Contract`,
  `Projection`, `Manifest`; a precise **canonicalization algorithm** for
  Semantic Fingerprint (normalization rules → byte stream → sha256).
- **Acceptance:** two independent serializations of the same model produce an
  identical fingerprint; a sample model validates against the schemas.
- **Depends on:** — (built first).

#### WS2 — MUFP protocol specification  · Source: Both
Turn "semantic diplomacy" into an implementable protocol.
- **Deliverables:** expand `03-federation/MUFP.md` + new
  `03-federation/MUFP-Messages.md`: state machine for the 9-stage lifecycle,
  message catalog (Discovery, Capability, Trust, Contract, Schema, Projection
  Exchange, Sync, Conflict, Terminate), envelope format, error taxonomy,
  version negotiation, Identity-Agreement revocation flow, one concrete
  binding (HTTP/JSON) and a worked handshake + projection-exchange transcript.
- **Acceptance:** a developer can implement a minimal MUFP endpoint from the doc
  alone; every message has a schema in `schemas/`.
- **Depends on:** WS1.

#### WS3 — Validation criteria + Conformance testability  · Source: Both
- **Deliverables:** complete `02-architecture/Validation.md` with explicit,
  per-level (V0–V5) checks and a sample Validation Report; **Requirement IDs**
  added to every normative `SHALL` across MUC/MMAS/MUFP; generated
  `REQUIREMENTS-INDEX.md`; Abstract Test Procedures mapping each level to checks;
  wire `06-ecosystem/Certification.md` to reproducible Validation output.
- **Acceptance:** each V-level lists checks that a tool could run; "MMAS A4" and
  "MUFP Level 3" become verifiable, not declarative.
- **Depends on:** WS1.

#### WS4 — Golden example + reference meta-models  · Source: Both
- **Deliverables:** one end-to-end scenario (e.g. *Acme HR ↔ Government Tax
  federate over `Person`*) threaded through the docs and materialized under
  `examples/`: 2–3 meta-models (incl. **Employee**) in MUIF + fingerprint +
  validation report + the federation transcript from WS2.
- **Acceptance:** every example validates (WS3) and round-trips a stable
  fingerprint (WS1); a reader can follow one object from Identity → Mapping →
  Contract → Projection → Sync → Conflict.
- **Depends on:** WS1, WS2, WS3.

#### WS5 — Security & privacy model  · Source: Both
- **Deliverables:** `03-federation/Security-Model.md` (threat model: spoofed
  Identity Bindings, poisoned Semantic Lineage, Projection leakage, Event replay,
  malicious Mappings, revocation propagation); "Security Considerations" section
  in every federation doc; concrete **Trust Vector** computation + **Identity
  Agreement / Trust revocation** mechanics; privacy/PII handling and a
  data-subject (GDPR-style) alignment note.
- **Acceptance:** every federation interaction in WS2/WS4 has a stated threat +
  mitigation; Trust Vector is computed from defined inputs.
- **Depends on:** WS2.

### Phase 2 — v2.2 "Make it verifiable & clean" (Important)

#### WS6 — Semantic Test Kit + golden files  · Source: Grok
Reproducible conformance: abstract tests + reference artifacts per V-level under
`tests/` with pass/fail golden files. **Depends on:** WS3, WS4.

#### WS7 — Interop appendix (demonstrated, not asserted)  · Source: Self
Real mappings `Object → RDF triple / OWL class`, plus Schema.org and FHIR, and
one fully imported Semantic Package, under `examples/interop/`. **Depends on:** WS1.

#### WS8 — Identifier scheme + CSN grammar  · Source: Self
Normative identifier scheme (or pluggable scheme registry) and an **ABNF grammar
for CSN**; folds into MUIF/Naming-Conventions. **Depends on:** WS1.

#### WS9 — Executable Discovery + machine-readable spec index  · Source: Self
`/.well-known/meta-universe.json` specification (public schemas, supported
MUC/MMAS/MUFP versions, capabilities); `spec-index.yaml` (every doc: ID, class,
status, version, dependencies); `AGENTS.md` / `llms.txt` AI-onboarding entry
point. **Depends on:** WS1, WS3.

#### WS10 — Structural cleanup & de-duplication  · Source: Grok
Single-source the repeated blocks (Architectural Invariants / Future Directions /
Final Statement); merge-or-clearly-split **Best-Practices ↔ Design-Recommendations**;
sharpen **Terminology (normative) ↔ Glossary (explanatory) ↔ Definitions
(constitutional)** boundaries; **reconcile the dropped v1.1 M1–M4 layers** in
`Architecture.md` / `Migration-from-v1.md`; add "Status of This Document" banners.
**Depends on:** —.

#### WS11 — Canonical diagrams + MUDL draft  · Source: Both
A canonical diagram set (Stack, Federation lifecycle, Projection, Identity
Binding, Event flow) as SVG/Mermaid assets under `assets/`; first MUDL draft
(`05-reference-architecture/MUDL.md`). **Depends on:** WS1.

#### WS12 — Governance, IPR & repo hygiene + Core Profile  · Source: Self
Operational `GOVERNANCE.md` (ratification, quorum, neutrality decision),
**IPR/patent policy**, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
`.github/` templates; define a **Core Profile / MVP conformance** subset; make an
explicit branding decision (Meta-Universe vs "metaverse" confusion).
**Depends on:** WS3, WS5.

### Phase 3 — v3.0 "Make it an ecosystem" (Valuable)

#### WS13 — Minimal reference CLI  · Source: Grok
`mu-validate`, `mu-fingerprint`, `mu-diff` (semantic diff over fingerprint +
lineage). Spec + minimal reference implementation. **Depends on:** WS1, WS3, WS6.

#### WS14 — Semantic Migration Standard (SMS)  · Source: Both
Standardize migration of *meaning* between versions (v1→v2 is already live).
**Depends on:** WS1, WS3.

#### WS15 — Semantic Coherence Score  · Source: Grok
Automated metric (Event completeness, Relationship consistency, Projection
coverage, provenance presence) enabling **graded** certification instead of
binary pass/fail. **Depends on:** WS3, WS6.

#### WS16 — Queryable Provenance Graph  · Source: Grok
Make Semantic Lineage a first-class queryable artifact: "what breaks if X
changes", "show all conclusions depending on this Event". **Depends on:** WS1.

#### WS17 — Decentralized Registry profile (DID + VC)  · Source: Grok
Realize Federation of Registries on Decentralized Identifiers + Verifiable
Credentials. **Depends on:** WS5, WS9.

#### WS18 — AI integration patterns + i18n  · Source: Both
Tool-calling schemas, structured-output constraints, RAG over Projections+Events,
a worked Executable Semantic Contract in an agent loop; multilingual model for
namespaces/labels/docs. **Depends on:** WS1, WS4.

### Phase 4 — Refinements from external review (Gemini)

A third review (Gemini) was assessed. Much of it was already covered — the
critique partly conflated Meta-Universe (this federation standard) with AISMM/FCD
(a domain meta-model + dev methodology built *on top* of it). Several of its
headline recommendations already exist here: **Federated/Mesh** is the standard's
core ([Federation of Registries](06-ecosystem/Registered-Meta-Models.md), MUFP,
Namespace publication); **Temporal / time-travel reasoning** is
[Event → Semantic Timeline](04-core-concepts/Event.md); **graph-poisoning as
attack surface** is the [Security Model](03-federation/Security-Model.md). The
genuinely net-new items are captured below.

#### WS19 — Virtual Projections & Hot/Cold Descriptive Facts  · Source: Gemini 2.2 / 3.1
Distinguish *cold* descriptive facts (schema, API, dependencies) from *hot* facts
(metrics, runtime state). Hot facts attach as **Virtual Stream Views** — live,
contract-governed projections an agent reads on the fly without mutating the
model. **Depends on:** WS1 (Projection/Event/Synchronization).

#### WS20 — Policy Consistency, Precedence & Deadlock Handling  · Source: Gemini 2.3 + 2.4
A **pre-merge Policy Consistency Check** (logical non-contradiction of normative
rules) before changes enter the canon; explicit rule **precedence/weights**; and
**deadlock detection** with mandatory human-in-the-loop escalation. Realizes the
"AI Reasoning Validation" arm of SVF. **Depends on:** WS3 (Validation), Change-Process.

#### WS21 — Outcome Drift Detection  · Source: Gemini 3.1
A "ghost-agent" audit comparing declared *purpose/hypothesis* (Model Canon)
against observed *outcomes* (descriptive metrics): code can be valid, tests green,
yet the business goal unmet → flag a semantic-outcome drift. Extends V5 runtime
validation. **Depends on:** WS3, WS19.

#### WS22 — Simulated Sandbox Projections  · Source: Gemini 3.3
A semantic **what-if**: simulate a proposed change in an isolated projected layer
(a digital shadow), run synthetic load, assess side effects across the model
*before* proposing it — without mutating canonical state. **Depends on:** WS1, WS20.

#### WS23 — Zero-Knowledge Policy Attestation  · Source: Gemini 3.4
For B2B federation, let one Universe **prove** its code/actions conform to agreed
security/compliance policies **without revealing** its graph or logic, using
zero-knowledge proofs and Verifiable Credentials. **Depends on:** WS5 (Security),
WS17 (DID/VC).

## 5. Critical path & execution order

```text
WS1 (MUIF) ─┬─> WS2 (MUFP) ─┬─> WS4 (golden example) ─> WS6 (test kit)
            │               └─> WS5 (security) ─> WS12 (governance/profile)
            ├─> WS3 (validation/req-IDs) ─> WS4, WS6, WS9, WS14, WS15
            ├─> WS7 (interop)   ├─> WS8 (identifiers/CSN)
            ├─> WS11 (diagrams) └─> WS16 (provenance graph)
            └─> WS9 (discovery/index)
WS10 (cleanup) runs in parallel, no dependency.
Phase 3 (WS13–18) follows once Phase 1–2 artifacts exist.
```

**Start point: WS1 (MUIF).** It unblocks almost everything.

## 6. Progress log

## 7. Definition of "mature"

The maturation pass is complete when:

- a minimal MUFP endpoint and a validator can be built **from the documents
  alone**;
- every normative requirement has an ID and at least one test;
- at least one full reference meta-model validates and round-trips a stable
  fingerprint;
- every federation interaction has a stated threat + mitigation;
- the scorecard in §1 reaches **8.5+** overall.
