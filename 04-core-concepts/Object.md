# 1. Purpose

This document defines the concept of a **Meta-Object**, the fundamental semantic building block of the Meta-Universe.

Every meaningful entity represented within a Meta-Universe SHALL be modeled as a Meta-Object or as a specialization of a Meta-Object.

---

# 2. Definition

A Meta-Object is a **Semantic Point of Truth** — the origin of meaning for an entity, not a database record.

A Meta-Object is a semantic representation of a real-world, conceptual, virtual or derived entity, defined by its identity, meaning, lifecycle and relationships rather than by its implementation.

Everything else derives from the Meta-Object. Its [Identity](../04-core-concepts/Identity.md), its [Relationships](../04-core-concepts/Relationship.md), the [Events](../04-core-concepts/Event.md) that record how it changes, its [Projections](../04-core-concepts/Projection.md), and its presence across multiple Universes are all derivations of a single Semantic Point of Truth. The Meta-Object is where the meaning of the entity *originates and exists*; the rest are governed views and consequences of that origin.

A Meta-Object SHALL NEVER be copied between Universes. When an entity owned by one Universe is needed by another, only [Projections](../04-core-concepts/Projection.md) cross the boundary — each linked back to the one Meta-Object through its Canonical [Identity](../04-core-concepts/Identity.md) and the governing federation agreements. The Meta-Object itself remains, singular and authoritative, in its owning Universe.

Meta-Objects represent **things**, not their various representations.

Representations are modeled as Projections.

---

# 2a. Not a Database Record

The Meta-Object describes the *architecture of the origin and existence of meaning*, not the storage of data. This distinguishes it from familiar data-centric concepts:

- Unlike classical **Master Data Management (MDM)**, the Meta-Object is not a "golden record" reconciled by copying and merging attributes from source systems; it is the sovereign origin of meaning, and other Universes hold governed Projections rather than synchronized copies.
- Unlike a **Knowledge Graph** node, the Meta-Object is not merely a vertex of attributes and edges in a store; identity, ownership, sovereignty and federation agreements are intrinsic to it.
- Unlike an **RDF resource**, the Meta-Object does not reduce to a set of triples interpretable by anyone who dereferences a URI; meaning exists only within the jurisdiction that owns it and is shared only under [Semantic Contracts](../04-core-concepts/Contract.md).

A conforming implementation SHALL treat the Meta-Object as the architectural point of truth and SHALL NOT conflate it with any physical storage of its attributes.

---

# 3. Object Principles

Every Meta-Object SHALL satisfy the following principles:

- possesses a permanent Identity;
- exists independently of any implementation technology;
- belongs to exactly one authoritative Universe;
- may have multiple Projections;
- may participate in Relationships;
- evolves through Events;
- remains traceable throughout its lifecycle.

---

# 4. Object Categories

Meta-Universe intentionally does not restrict object types.

Typical categories include:

- Physical entities
- People
- Organizations
- Digital assets
- Software systems
- Products
- Services
- Documents
- Processes
- Events
- AI Agents
- Concepts
- Roles
- Capabilities
- Derived objects

Domain Meta-Models MAY define additional categories.

---

# 5. Identity

Every Meta-Object SHALL possess one canonical Identity.

Identity SHALL:

- remain stable;
- be globally unique;
- survive version changes;
- survive ownership changes;
- survive implementation migration.

Identity SHALL NOT encode mutable business meaning.

---

# 6. Ownership

Every Meta-Object SHALL have an authoritative owner.

Ownership determines semantic authority.

Ownership SHALL remain explicitly traceable.

Ownership MAY be delegated without changing object identity.

---

# 7. Lifecycle

Every Meta-Object SHALL possess a lifecycle.

Typical lifecycle states include:

- Created
- Active
- Deprecated
- Archived
- Retired

Domain Meta-Models MAY introduce additional states.

Lifecycle SHALL remain explicit.

---

# 8. Properties

Meta-Objects MAY contain Properties.

Properties describe the current semantic characteristics of the object.

Properties SHALL NOT redefine object identity.

Property evolution SHALL remain traceable.

---

# 9. Relationships

Meta-Objects MAY participate in Relationships.

Relationships SHALL be first-class semantic artifacts.

Relationships MAY possess:

- identity;
- lifecycle;
- ownership;
- provenance;
- version history.

Relationships SHALL NOT be represented merely as implementation references.

---

# 10. Events

Every significant change affecting a Meta-Object SHOULD be represented as an Event.

Events are immutable.

Events document object evolution rather than overwrite history.

---

# 11. Projections

A Meta-Object MAY have zero or more Projections.

Each Projection represents the object within a specific:

- context;
- purpose;
- audience;
- disclosure policy.

All Projections SHALL reference the same canonical Identity.

---

# 12. Traceability

Every Meta-Object SHALL preserve:

- provenance;
- ownership history;
- version history;
- semantic lineage;
- event history;
- relationship history.

Traceability SHALL survive federation.

---

# 13. Federation

A Meta-Object MAY participate in federation.

Federation SHALL exchange semantic Projections rather than transferring ownership of the Meta-Object. A Meta-Object SHALL NEVER be copied between Universes.

Each [Projection](../04-core-concepts/Projection.md) exchanged across a boundary SHALL reference exactly one Meta-Object, linked through its Canonical [Identity](../04-core-concepts/Identity.md) and governed by the applicable federation agreements. A receiving Universe therefore holds a view that resolves back to the single Semantic Point of Truth, never a competing source of truth.

The authoritative Universe SHALL remain the source of truth for the canonical object.

---

# 14. Public Metadata

Every public Meta-Object SHOULD expose at least:

- canonical identifier;
- object type;
- namespace;
- version;
- lifecycle state;
- owner reference;
- originating Universe.

Additional metadata MAY require authorization.

---

# 15. Imported Objects

Objects imported from external standards SHALL preserve:

- canonical identity;
- originating namespace;
- provenance;
- version.

Imported objects MAY be locally extended.

Extensions SHALL remain additive.

---

# 16. Object Replacement

Replacing one Meta-Object with another SHALL create a new Identity.

Historical references SHALL continue to reference the original object.

Replacement SHALL remain explicitly traceable.

---

# 17. Architectural Invariants

Every Meta-Object SHALL preserve:

- identity;
- semantic meaning;
- ownership;
- provenance;
- traceability;
- constitutional compliance.

Implementations SHALL distinguish between the Meta-Object itself and any of its Projections.

---

# Future Directions

Framing the Meta-Object as a Semantic Point of Truth — rather than a stored record — anticipates a future articulation of how the origin of meaning is verified across jurisdictions: how a Universe proves it is the sole authoritative source of a Meta-Object, how Projections everywhere remain provably bound to it through Identity and federation agreements, and how this contrasts operationally with MDM golden records, Knowledge Graphs and RDF stores. The [Event](../04-core-concepts/Event.md) primitive and the Semantic Timeline provide the temporal substrate for this verification. This direction is anticipated but not yet normative.

---

# Final Statement

A Meta-Object is the canonical semantic representation of an entity within the Meta-Universe.

It is the stable source of meaning from which identities, relationships, events and projections originate, enabling independent Universes to exchange trustworthy knowledge without sacrificing semantic authority or long-term continuity.
