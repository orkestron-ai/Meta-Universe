# 1. Purpose

This document defines the concept of a **Universe**, the highest semantic authority within the Meta-Universe architecture.

A Universe represents an autonomous semantic authority capable of defining, governing and evolving its own semantic reality while participating in federation with other Universes.

---

# 2. Definition

A Universe is the **supreme semantic jurisdiction** of the Meta-Universe.

A Universe is **not** a container of objects. Like a sovereign state, a Universe is defined by its laws, its authority, its identity and its trust system, not by the entities that reside within it. The objects, relationships and projections inside a Universe exist because a jurisdiction grants them meaning, governs their interpretation and stands behind their truth.

A Universe is an independent semantic jurisdiction that:

- owns its own semantic space;
- governs its own models;
- defines its own laws and policies;
- manages its own identities;
- operates its own trust system;
- participates in federation voluntarily.

A Universe is the highest level of semantic sovereignty defined by Meta-Universe.

A Universe SHALL be characterized by its constitutional laws, governing authority, identity system and trust system rather than by any inventory of the objects it holds.

---

# 2a. Kinds of Universe

A Universe MAY be of one of three kinds. All three kinds are equal in standing, governed by the **same Constitution** ([MUC](../01-constitution/Meta-Universe-Constitution.md)) and federated through the **same federation protocol** ([MUFP](../03-federation/MUFP.md)). They differ only in what owns the jurisdiction and what part of reality it governs.

## Physical Universe

A Physical Universe owns part of the real world. Its authority derives from a real-world entity such as a company, a government or a person. The semantic reality it governs corresponds to assets, people, contracts and processes that exist outside the Meta-Universe.

## Logical Universe

A Logical Universe is an independent semantic area within a single organization. It carries its own laws, identity and trust system, yet its sovereignty is exercised on behalf of the same owning organization. Logical Universes allow one organization to maintain distinct semantic jurisdictions (for example by regulatory regime, market or product line) without fragmenting ownership.

## Virtual Universe

A Virtual Universe is a fully artificial jurisdiction, owned by AI agents or digital organizations. It governs semantic reality that exists only within the Meta-Universe. A Virtual Universe SHALL hold the same sovereignty, identity and trust obligations as any other Universe; its owner is a digital rather than a human or governmental entity.

A Universe SHALL declare its kind as part of its public metadata. The kind SHALL NOT alter the constitutional obligations of the Universe.

---

# 3. Characteristics

Every Universe SHALL possess:

- a globally unique identity;
- an owner or governing authority;
- one or more Dimensions;
- governance policies;
- version information;
- federation capabilities (optional).

Universes MAY be public, private or hybrid.

---

# 4. Sovereignty

A Universe SHALL remain sovereign.

Federation SHALL NOT transfer:

- ownership;
- governance;
- semantic authority;
- identity.

Every Universe remains authoritative for its own semantic knowledge.

---

# 5. Semantic Authority

Each Universe defines:

- its own semantic models;
- accepted external standards;
- local extensions;
- trust policies;
- disclosure policies;
- federation policies.

No external Universe SHALL redefine these decisions.

---

# 6. Internal Structure

A Universe SHALL contain one or more Dimensions.

Dimensions organize independent semantic domains within the same Universe.

Recommended hierarchy:

Universe
    └── Dimension
            └── Namespace
                    └── Objects

This hierarchy is architectural rather than physical.

---

# 7. Ownership

Every Universe SHALL declare its governing owner.

Ownership MAY belong to:

- an organization;
- an individual;
- a government;
- an AI-native organization;
- another legally recognized governing entity.

Ownership SHALL remain explicit.

---

# 8. Identity

Every Universe SHALL expose a stable global identifier.

Identifiers SHALL remain stable throughout the lifetime of the Universe.

Names MAY evolve.

Identifiers SHALL NOT.

---

# 9. Federation

A Universe MAY participate in federation.

Federation SHALL occur through MUFP.

Participation SHALL be voluntary.

Universes MAY:

- federate;
- partially federate;
- remain isolated.

Isolation SHALL NOT affect constitutional conformance.

---

# 10. Public Metadata

A conforming Universe SHOULD expose public metadata including:

- identifier;
- display name;
- version;
- owner;
- supported MUC version;
- supported MMAS version;
- supported MUFP version;
- available federation profiles;
- supported namespaces.

Public metadata SHALL NOT require disclosure of private semantic knowledge.

---

# 11. Discovery

A Universe MAY support semantic discovery.

Discovery SHOULD begin with public metadata and schema discovery before any request for instance data.

Schema discovery SHALL be independent from data disclosure.

---

# 12. Evolution

Universes evolve independently.

Evolution SHALL preserve:

- identity;
- ownership;
- constitutional compliance.

Federated universes MAY evolve at different rates.

Version negotiation SHALL resolve interoperability.

---

# 13. Typical Examples

Examples of Universes include:

- an enterprise;
- a government;
- a university;
- an AI platform;
- an individual person;
- an IoT ecosystem;
- a consortium of organizations.

The concept is intentionally technology independent.

---

# 14. Architectural Invariants

Every Universe SHALL preserve:

- sovereignty;
- semantic authority;
- identity;
- ownership;
- traceability;
- constitutional compliance.

No federation activity SHALL violate these invariants.

---

# Future Directions

The jurisdictional framing of the Universe invites a future **Universe Charter Standard** describing how the constitutional laws, identity system and trust system of a Universe are formally declared, published and verified, and how the three kinds (Physical, Logical, Virtual) are certified against the Constitution. Such a standard would also define how Virtual Universes — owned by AI agents and digital organizations — establish accountable governing authority where no human or governmental owner exists. These directions are anticipated but not yet normative.

---

# Final Statement

A Universe is the highest autonomous semantic authority within the Meta-Universe architecture.

Its purpose is not to centralize knowledge but to provide a sovereign semantic boundary within which knowledge can be governed, evolved and, when appropriate, federated with other universes through shared constitutional principles and federation protocols.
