# 1. Purpose

This document defines the Identity Model for the Meta-Universe.

Identity is one of the constitutional foundations of Meta-Universe. It enables semantic continuity, traceability and federation by ensuring that every meaningful entity can be uniquely and persistently identified throughout its lifecycle — and, where two sovereign Universes recognize the same entity, by ensuring that this recognition is itself a governed agreement rather than a coincidence of identifiers.

---

# 2. Definition

An Identity is the permanent semantic identifier of an entity.

Identity SHALL represent *what the entity is*, not *how it is described*.

Identity is more than a UUID. A bare identifier is a local fact; **Identity in the Meta-Universe is a constitutional agreement between Universes.** When two sovereign Universes assert that "this is the same object", they do not merely compare strings — they enter an **Identity Agreement**, a governed recognition exchanged through federation. There is no central registry that decrees sameness; sameness exists only as a federated agreement between the Universes that hold it.

Identity SHALL remain independent of:

- names;
- labels;
- attributes;
- ownership;
- location;
- implementation technology;
- projections.

Identity is immutable.

Representations are not.

# 2a. The Three Forms of Identity

The Meta-Universe distinguishes three forms of Identity. Together they allow the same real entity to be recognized across jurisdictions without flattening it into a single global key.

## Canonical Identity

The Canonical Identity is *who the object is to its owner* — the permanent, owner-issued identity within the authoritative Universe. It is the source of truth for the entity's existence.

## Local Identity

A Local Identity is *how the object appears inside a particular Universe*. A consuming Universe MAY assign its own local identifier when it references an entity owned elsewhere. A Local Identity SHALL NOT replace the Canonical Identity; it is a jurisdiction-internal handle.

## Federated Identity Mapping

A Federated Identity Mapping is the *official link* between a Canonical Identity and a Local Identity — the recorded form of an Identity Agreement. It states, traceably and bilaterally, that two identifiers denote the same entity, under which authority, and from which point in time.

**Example.** `employee:12345` in a company Universe, `citizen:99821` in a government Universe, and `student:A-10455` in a university Universe MAY all be projections of one Canonical Identity. No party owns all three. Each pairing is bound by a Federated Identity Mapping; the set of mappings — not a central directory — is what makes the three "the same person".

A Federated Identity Mapping SHALL be traceable, SHALL identify the governing authority, and SHALL remain revocable in accordance with the agreement that established it.

---

# 3. Identity Principles

Every Identity SHALL satisfy the following principles:

- Globally unique
- Persistent
- Stable
- Technology independent
- Traceable
- Federatable
- Non-semantic
- Immutable

Identity SHALL NEVER encode business meaning that may change over time.

---

# 4. Identity Scope

The Identity Model applies to all significant semantic artifacts, including:

- Universes
- Dimensions
- Namespaces
- Meta-Models
- Bundles
- Layers
- Objects
- Relationships
- Events
- Contracts
- Projections
- Semantic Packages

Domain-specific standards MAY introduce additional identity-bearing concepts.

---

# 5. Canonical Identity

Every identity SHALL consist of a canonical identifier.

Recommended properties include:

- identifier
- issuing authority
- creation timestamp
- lifecycle state
- current version reference

Display names SHALL NOT be considered identifiers.

---

# 6. Identity Lifecycle

An Identity MAY transition through the following lifecycle:

Created

↓

Active

↓

Deprecated

↓

Archived

↓

Retired

The identifier SHALL remain permanently reserved, even after retirement.

Identifiers SHALL NOT be reused.

---

# 7. Identity and Ownership

Identity SHALL remain independent from ownership.

Ownership MAY change.

Identity SHALL NOT.

Ownership transfers SHALL preserve the original identity.

---

# 8. Identity and Projection

A Projection SHALL reference the identity of its source object.

Multiple projections MAY exist simultaneously.

All projections SHALL preserve the same canonical identity.

Projection-specific identifiers MAY exist locally but SHALL NOT replace the canonical identity.

---

# 9. Identity Across Federation

Federated Universes SHALL preserve canonical identities whenever referring to the same semantic entity.

If local identifiers are required, explicit Federated Identity Mappings SHALL be maintained.

Identity mappings SHALL remain traceable.

Federation SHALL exchange Identity Agreements through MUFP. There SHALL be no central identity registry. The assertion that two Universes refer to the same entity SHALL exist solely as a bilateral (or multilateral) Identity Agreement, recorded as a Federated Identity Mapping by each participating Universe. Either party MAY revoke its participation in an Identity Agreement in accordance with the governing federation contract, without altering the Canonical Identity held by the owner.

---

# 10. Imported Identities

Imported concepts SHALL preserve their original identities whenever possible.

Local identifiers MAY be introduced as aliases.

Aliases SHALL explicitly reference the canonical identity.

Imported identity SHALL remain authoritative.

---

# 11. Identity Resolution

Conforming implementations SHOULD support identity resolution.

Resolution SHOULD determine:

- canonical identity;
- current state;
- originating Universe;
- owner;
- available projections;
- semantic mappings.

Resolution MAY require authorization.

---

# 12. Identity Evolution

Identity SHALL survive:

- version changes;
- ownership transfers;
- namespace evolution;
- federation;
- projection changes;
- implementation migration.

Identity SHALL NOT survive semantic replacement by a different entity.

Replacement SHALL create a new identity.

---

# 13. Identity Collision

Two distinct semantic entities SHALL NEVER intentionally share the same canonical identity.

If a collision is detected, it SHALL be resolved through governance and traceable correction procedures.

Collision SHALL NEVER be resolved by silently changing historical identities.

---

# 14. Identity Metadata

Every identity SHOULD expose:

- identifier;
- issuing authority;
- creation date;
- status;
- provenance;
- owner reference;
- originating Universe;
- version reference.

Additional metadata MAY be defined by domain-specific Meta-Models.

---

# 15. Architectural Invariants

Identity SHALL preserve:

- continuity;
- uniqueness;
- traceability;
- constitutional compliance;
- federation compatibility.

Identity SHALL NEVER depend upon implementation details.

---

# Future Directions

Treating Identity as a constitutional agreement rather than a key anticipates a future **Identity Agreement protocol** within MUFP, defining how Identity Agreements are proposed, accepted, recorded as Federated Identity Mappings, audited and revoked between sovereign Universes — entirely without a central registry. Such a protocol would also describe how conflicting agreements (the same Local Identity mapped to two different Canonical Identities) are detected and resolved through governance and Conflict Preservation rather than silent overwrite. This direction is anticipated but not yet normative.

---

# Final Statement

Identity is the foundation of semantic continuity within Meta-Universe.

Names, structures, ownership and representations may evolve over time, but identity remains constant. This permanence enables trustworthy federation, long-term traceability and reliable semantic interoperability across independent Universes.
