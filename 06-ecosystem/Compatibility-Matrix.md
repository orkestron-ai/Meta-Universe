# 1. Purpose

This document defines the recommended Compatibility Matrix for Meta-Universe compliant assets.

The Compatibility Matrix provides a standardized method for declaring interoperability between Meta-Models, standards, Federation Profiles and implementations. It enables both humans and AI agents to quickly determine whether semantic federation can be established and under which conditions.

---

# 2. Scope

The Compatibility Matrix can describe compatibility between:

- Meta-Models;
- MUC versions;
- MMAS versions;
- MUFP versions;
- Federation Profiles;
- imported standards;
- Semantic Packages;
- implementations.

---

# 3. Design Principles

Compatibility declarations are expected to be:

- explicit;
- version-aware;
- traceable;
- machine-readable;
- technology independent;
- reproducible.

Compatibility is declared rather than assumed.

---

# 4. Compatibility Dimensions

Compatibility is not a single yes/no value. It is *multidimensional*: two assets may align perfectly on one axis and require work on another. Compatibility is therefore evaluated independently across:

- Constitutional compatibility (MUC);
- Architectural compatibility (MMAS);
- Federation compatibility (MUFP);
- Semantic compatibility;
- Namespace compatibility;
- Identity compatibility;
- Mapping availability;
- Projection compatibility;
- Validation compatibility.

Each axis yields its own result. A typical multidimensional verdict reads, for example:

- **MUC compatible** — both assets obey the same constitutional principles;
- **MMAS compatible** — their architectural structures align;
- **MUFP requires upgrade** — federation needs a newer protocol version on one side;
- **Semantic Mapping available** — concept differences are bridged by a published mapping;
- **Federation Profile required** — interaction depends on a specific profile being loaded;
- **Projection Profile supported** — a suitable Projection Profile exists for the exchange;
- **Validation certified** — conformance has been independently verified.

A consumer reads the whole vector, not a single label, to understand exactly what aligns and what must be prepared.

---

# 5. Compatibility Levels

Recommended levels:

- Native
- Compatible
- Compatible with Mapping
- Compatible with Transformation
- Experimental
- Incompatible

Every declared level is accompanied by supporting evidence.

---

# 6. Matrix Structure

A matrix entry typically includes:

- Source Model;
- Target Model;
- Source Version;
- Target Version;
- Compatibility Level;
- Required Semantic Mappings;
- Required Federation Profile;
- Validation Status;
- Notes.

---

# 7. Example Matrix

| Source | Target | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Employee Meta-Model | Organization Meta-Model | Native |
| Employee Meta-Model | O*NET | Compatible with Mapping |
| Employee Meta-Model | ESCO | Compatible with Mapping |
| Employee Meta-Model | Schema.org | Compatible with Transformation |
| Employee Meta-Model | HL7 FHIR | Experimental |

This table is illustrative.

---

# 8. Version Compatibility

Compatibility is version specific.

Example:

- Employee MM 2.x ↔ Organization MM 2.x : Compatible
- Employee MM 2.x ↔ Organization MM 1.x : Mapping Required

Major version changes typically trigger compatibility review.

---

# 9. Federation Compatibility

Compatibility declares:

- supported MUFP version;
- supported Federation Profiles;
- supported Projection Profiles;
- supported Identity Binding model;
- synchronization capabilities.

---

# 10. Imported Standards

Compatibility can be published for imported standards including:

- Schema.org
- OData CSDL
- HL7 FHIR
- O*NET
- ESCO
- BPMN
- ArchiMate

Mappings are referenced instead of duplicated.

---

# 11. Validation

Compatibility validation verifies:

- version alignment;
- namespace consistency;
- mapping availability;
- profile compatibility;
- contract requirements;
- semantic integrity.

Validation produces reproducible results.

---

# 12. Publication

Compatibility information is published together with:

- repository metadata;
- registered Meta-Model entry;
- release notes;
- validation reports.

Consumers can discover compatibility before adoption.

---

# 13. Governance

Compatibility declarations identify:

- publishing authority;
- publication date;
- supported versions;
- review status.

Compatibility is periodically revalidated.

---

# 14. Architectural Invariants

Compatibility preserves:

- semantic sovereignty;
- canonical identities;
- provenance;
- traceability;
- constitutional compliance.

Declaring compatibility does not modify either participating model.

---

# 15. Automated Compatibility Resolution

Because the matrix is multidimensional and machine-readable, AI agents can resolve compatibility automatically before any interaction begins. Given two assets and their versions, an agent reads the compatibility vector and determines:

- **Can we interact at all** — do the constitutional and architectural axes align;
- **Which Semantic Mappings to load** — which published mappings bridge the concept differences;
- **Is a version upgrade needed** — does any axis report *requires upgrade* on either side;
- **Which Federation Profile to use** — which profile the interaction depends on;
- **What constraints apply** — which Projection Profiles, disclosure rules and validation requirements govern the exchange.

The closest analogy is *dependency resolution in package managers*: just as a package manager resolves versions, transitive dependencies and required features before installing software, a Meta-Universe agent resolves standards versions, required mappings, profiles and constraints before federating. The Compatibility Matrix is the dependency graph of a semantic ecosystem, and federation is the equivalent of a successful resolved install.

---

# 16. Future Directions

A future **Semantic Validation Framework (SVF)** could standardize how each compatibility axis is computed and evidenced, turning the matrix from a published table into a verifiable, queryable resolution service. Such a service would let agents request a resolution plan ("what do I need to federate A with B?") and receive an ordered list of mappings, profile loads and upgrades — a semantic equivalent of a resolved dependency lockfile, cross-referenced with [Certification](Certification.md) results.

---

# Final Statement

The Compatibility Matrix provides a transparent and reusable mechanism for evaluating interoperability across the Meta-Universe ecosystem.

By publishing explicit compatibility information, organizations enable predictable federation, informed adoption and automated reasoning while preserving semantic autonomy, governance and long-term evolution of independently managed Meta-Models.
