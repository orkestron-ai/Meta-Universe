# Purpose

This document defines the fundamental design principles that guide every standard within the Meta-Universe family.

Unlike the Meta-Universe Constitution (MUC), these principles explain the architectural philosophy rather than define normative requirements.

This document is **Informative**.

# A Declaration of Architectural Values

The Meta-Universe rests on seventeen principles. Rather than a flat list, they are organized into **four families of values**, so that the architecture reads as a single, coherent system of beliefs:

| Family | Question it answers | Principles |
|--------|---------------------|------------|
| **Reality Principles** | How do we relate to the world? | R1–R3 |
| **Federation Principles** | How do independent universes cooperate? | F1–F8 |
| **Architecture Principles** | How is the system built and kept legible? | A1–A4 |
| **Longevity Principles** | How does it survive across decades? | L1–L2 |

From these families grow the articles of the [Constitution](../01-constitution/Meta-Universe-Constitution.md), the rules of [MMAS](../02-architecture/MMAS-Core.md) and the requirements of [MUFP](../03-federation/MUFP.md).

# Reality Principles

*How the Meta-Universe relates to the world it describes.*

## R1. Reality First

Meta-models exist to describe reality, not replace it.

A semantic model should remain a faithful representation of the world it describes.

Implementation technology must never become the primary design driver.

## R2. Identity Before Representation

Every meaningful entity possesses a stable identity.

Names, attributes, locations and representations may evolve.

Identity should remain constant throughout the object's lifetime.

## R3. Context Is Part of Truth

Facts cannot be interpreted independently from their context.

The same object may legitimately have different properties, meanings or responsibilities in different semantic universes.

Context is not metadata. Context is part of the meaning.

---

# Federation Principles

*How independent universes cooperate without surrendering autonomy.*

## F1. Projection Instead of Duplication

Universes exchange projections rather than complete objects.

A projection is a context-specific representation created for a defined purpose.

Objects remain sovereign. Projections are disposable.

## F2. Federation Before Centralization

Whenever possible, independent universes should cooperate through federation rather than by copying or centralizing data.

Federation preserves autonomy while enabling collaboration.

## F3. Sovereignty of Universes

Every semantic universe governs its own objects, policies and evolution.

Participation in federation never transfers ownership or governance.

## F4. Shared Schema Before Shared Data

Semantic interoperability begins with a common understanding of structure.

The existence of a public schema does not imply public access to data.

Models should be discoverable even when instances remain private.

## F5. Knowledge Is Exchanged Through Contracts

Knowledge should never be disclosed implicitly.

Every exchange should occur within an explicit purpose, scope and agreement.

Contracts govern knowledge sharing, not ownership.

## F6. Least Knowledge

Every participant should receive only the minimum knowledge required to accomplish an agreed purpose.

The objective is not to maximize access but to minimize unnecessary disclosure.

## F7. Purpose-Driven Access

Every request for knowledge should declare its purpose.

Authorization depends not only on identity but also on intended use.

The same information may be disclosed for one purpose and denied for another.

## F8. Trust Is Established

Trust is never assumed.

Trust must be built through verifiable identity, provenance, evidence and explicit agreements.

# Architecture Principles

*How the system is built and kept understandable to humans and machines.*

## A1. Traceability by Design

Every significant semantic fact should be explainable.

Its origin, ownership, evolution and dependencies should remain traceable throughout its lifecycle.

## A2. Open Architecture

Meta-Universe is designed to integrate existing semantic standards rather than replace them.

External models should be imported, extended and federated whenever possible.

## A3. Human and AI Readable

Every specification should be understandable by both humans and intelligent agents.

Clarity, explicit semantics and machine-readable structures are first-class design goals.

## A4. Technology Independence

The architecture must outlive individual programming languages, databases, protocols and storage technologies.

The standards define semantics rather than implementations.

---

# Longevity Principles

*How the standard survives evolution across decades.*

## L1. Evolution Without Disruption

Meta-models are expected to evolve.

Versioning, compatibility and migration should enable continuous evolution without unnecessary fragmentation.

## L2. Long-Term Stability

Identifiers, semantic meaning and constitutional principles should remain stable across decades.

Evolution is expected. Unnecessary breaking changes are not.

---

# Closing Statement

These principles express the architectural philosophy of Meta-Universe.

The Meta-Universe Constitution transforms these principles into normative rules.

All subsequent standards are expected to be consistent with both.
