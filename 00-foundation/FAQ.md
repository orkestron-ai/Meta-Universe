# 1. Purpose

This document answers common questions about the Meta-Universe and provides practical explanations that complement the normative specifications.

The FAQ is intended for newcomers, architects, developers, domain experts and AI practitioners.

# 1a. The Foundation Ladder of Understanding

The documents in section 00-foundation form a **ladder of understanding**. They are deliberately non-technical and are meant to be climbed in order, each rung building the mental model needed for the next:

```text
README  →  Vision  →  Principles  →  Terminology  →  Glossary  →  FAQ
```

- **README** orients the reader and shows where everything lives.
- **Vision** explains why the Meta-Universe exists.
- **Principles** state the values that constrain every later decision.
- **Terminology** fixes the official meaning of each concept.
- **Glossary** makes those meanings intuitive through examples.
- **FAQ** (this document) resolves the questions that remain.

The ladder builds a complete mental model **before** the reader reaches the Constitution. The intended flow for humans is **idea → specification**: understand the concepts first, then read the normative standards that formalize them.

AI agents do not need the ladder. An AI agent MAY consume Terminology and the other normative documents directly, since those documents are self-contained and machine-interpretable. The ladder exists for human comprehension, not as a prerequisite for automated reasoning.

# 2. General Questions

## What is Meta-Universe?

Meta-Universe is an open family of standards for describing, governing and federating semantic knowledge across independent organizations, AI systems and digital ecosystems.

---

## Is Meta-Universe a platform?

No.

It is an architecture and standards framework that can be implemented by many different platforms and organizations.

---

## Is Meta-Universe a database?

No.

It defines semantic architecture, not storage technology.

---

## Is Meta-Universe an ontology?

Not exactly.

Ontologies may be imported or represented inside Meta-Universe, but Meta-Universe also defines governance, identity, federation, lifecycle and architectural principles.

---

# 3. Meta-Models

## What is a Meta-Model?

A Meta-Model is a structured semantic description of a domain including Objects, Relationships, Events, Contexts and Projections.

---

## Why not use database schemas?

Database schemas describe storage.

Meta-Models describe meaning.

Implementation may change while semantic meaning remains stable.

---

## Why create many Domain Meta-Models?

Smaller bounded models are easier to understand, evolve and federate.

---

# 4. Federation

## What is federation?

Federation allows independent Universes to collaborate while preserving ownership and semantic sovereignty.

---

## Is federation data replication?

No.

Knowledge is exchanged through governed Projections rather than unrestricted copies.

---

## Why are Semantic Contracts required?

Contracts define purpose, permissions, responsibilities and disclosure rules before knowledge is exchanged.

---

# 5. Identity

## Why distinguish Canonical Identity and Local Identity?

Local identifiers belong to individual systems.

Canonical Identity provides a stable semantic identity across the federation.

---

## What is Identity Binding?

Identity Binding connects local identifiers to one Canonical Identity without changing ownership.

---

# 6. AI

## Why is Meta-Universe important for AI?

AI systems reason more reliably when knowledge is explicit, structured, versioned and traceable.

---

## Does Meta-Universe replace LLMs?

No.

LLMs provide reasoning.

Meta-Universe provides structured knowledge, governance and explainability.

Together they enable AI-native systems.

---

# 7. Governance

## Who owns a Meta-Model?

The publishing organization or community retains ownership.

Federation never transfers ownership automatically.

---

## Who controls the standard?

The Meta-Universe standards evolve through transparent governance defined by the Constitution and Change Process.

---

# 8. Adoption

## Can existing standards be reused?

Yes.

Existing standards such as Schema.org, OData, HL7 FHIR, ESCO and O*NET may be imported through Semantic Mappings.

---

## Can existing systems adopt Meta-Universe gradually?

Yes.

Migration is incremental and historical artifacts are preserved.

---

# 9. Best Practices

## Should every project have its own Meta-Model?

Only when necessary.

Always search existing Meta-Models before creating new ones.

---

## What is the biggest design mistake?

Modeling implementation details instead of semantic reality.

---

# 10. Where to Go Next

Recommended reading order:

1. Vision
2. Principles
3. Terminology
4. Glossary
5. Constitution
6. Core Concepts
7. MMAS
8. MUFP
9. Guides

# Final Statement

The Meta-Universe FAQ provides practical answers to the most common questions about the ecosystem.

By complementing the normative specifications with concise explanations, this document lowers the learning curve and helps architects, developers, organizations and AI practitioners adopt Meta-Universe concepts with confidence while preserving the architectural principles defined by the standards.
