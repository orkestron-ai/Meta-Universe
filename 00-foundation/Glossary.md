# 1. Purpose

This glossary provides plain-language explanations of the concepts used throughout the Meta-Universe standards.

Unlike **Terminology.md**, which contains normative definitions, this document explains ideas through intuition, examples and practical guidance.

It is intended for architects, developers, domain experts, students and AI practitioners.

# 1a. Position Among the Vocabulary Documents

The Glossary is the **human-oriented encyclopedia** of the Meta-Universe. It is informative: it builds intuition, gives examples and frames concepts for newcomers. It is deliberately distinct from its two siblings:

- **Terminology.md** is the **normative dictionary**. It fixes the official, short meaning of each term and is the authority that other specifications cite. When precision matters, Terminology decides.
- **Definitions.md** is the **constitutional interpretation**. It states how selected terms are read when applying the Meta-Universe Constitution (MUC), and it governs governance, conformance and dispute resolution.

This Glossary explains; it never overrides. Where this document and a normative document appear to differ, the normative document prevails.

---

# 2. How to Use This Glossary

When reading the specifications:

- Use **Terminology.md** to determine the official meaning of a term.
- Use this glossary to understand the concept behind that term.
- Use **Definitions.md** when the question concerns constitutional interpretation.
- Use the Core Concepts documents for the complete architectural model.

# 3. Core Concepts

## Universe

Think of a Universe as an independent semantic ecosystem.

An enterprise, a government, a person, an AI platform or even a digital twin may own its own Universe.

Every Universe governs its own knowledge.

---

## Dimension

A Dimension is a large semantic space inside a Universe.

It separates different knowledge domains without creating separate Universes.

---

## Namespace

A Namespace groups related concepts.

For example:

- employee
- organization
- product
- finance

In Meta-Universe v2 the Namespace replaces the former Galaxy concept.

---

## Meta-Object

A Meta-Object is the digital semantic identity of something that exists (or is meaningful).

Examples include:

- Employee
- Company
- Product
- Invoice
- AI Agent

A Meta-Object represents meaning rather than storage.

---

## Projection

A Projection is a view of a Meta-Object.

Different audiences receive different Projections of the same object.

Example:

The HR department, Payroll system and an external partner may all see different information about the same employee.

---

## Context

Context explains *why* knowledge is being used.

The same information may have different meanings depending on:

- purpose;
- audience;
- time;
- assumptions.

Without Context, semantic interpretation becomes unreliable.

---

## Event

An Event records something that happened.

Examples:

- Employee hired
- Product released
- Contract approved

Events explain how knowledge evolved.

---

## Relationship

Relationships connect Meta-Objects.

Examples:

Employee reportsTo Manager.

Product belongsTo Catalog.

Relationships express business meaning.

---

## Canonical Identity

The permanent identity of a Meta-Object.

Even if local systems change identifiers, the Canonical Identity remains stable.

---

## Identity Binding

Identity Binding connects local identifiers to one Canonical Identity.

This allows independent systems to recognize the same real-world object.

---

## Semantic Contract

A Semantic Contract defines the rules for exchanging knowledge.

It specifies:

- purpose;
- permissions;
- responsibilities;
- disclosure conditions.

---

## Semantic Mapping

A Semantic Mapping explains how concepts from different Meta-Models correspond.

It allows independently designed models to work together.

---

## Federation

Federation allows independent Universes to collaborate while remaining autonomous.

Knowledge is shared without surrendering ownership.

---

## Semantic Sovereignty

Every Universe owns and governs its own knowledge.

Participation in federation never transfers ownership.

---

## Provenance

Provenance answers:

"Where did this knowledge come from?"

Knowing the origin of information increases trust.

---

## Traceability

Traceability answers:

"How did we get here?"

Every important change can be reconstructed through history.

---

## Governance

Governance defines who makes decisions and how standards evolve.

It ensures predictable long-term development.

---

## Compatibility

Compatibility describes whether two semantic artifacts can work together.

Compatibility is explicit rather than assumed.

---

## Certification

Certification is independent evidence that something conforms to Meta-Universe standards.

Certification builds trust without changing ownership.

---

## AI Agent

An AI Agent is more than an LLM.

Within the Meta-Universe, an AI Agent reasons using:

- Meta-Models;
- Context;
- Contracts;
- Projections;
- Events.

Knowledge exists outside the language model, making decisions more explainable and reusable.

---

# 4. Common Misconceptions

**A Meta-Model is not a database schema.**

It describes meaning, not storage.

**A Projection is not a copy of data.**

It is a purpose-specific representation.

**Federation is not data replication.**

It is governed semantic collaboration.

**Trust is not authentication.**

Trust also includes governance, purpose and contractual obligations.

# 5. Learning Path

For readers new to Meta-Universe:

1. Read Vision.
2. Read Principles.
3. Read Terminology.
4. Read this Glossary.
5. Read the Constitution.
6. Continue with Core Concepts.

The recommended progression is therefore **Vision → Principles → Terminology → Glossary → Constitution**: the Vision sets intent, the Principles set values, Terminology fixes the official meanings, this Glossary makes those meanings intuitive, and the Constitution makes them binding.

---

# Final Statement

The Glossary bridges the gap between formal specifications and practical understanding.

By explaining the concepts behind the Meta-Universe in clear, human-readable language, it helps architects, developers, domain experts and AI practitioners build a shared mental model before exploring the normative standards that define the ecosystem.
