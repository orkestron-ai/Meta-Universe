# 1. Purpose

This document defines the architectural requirements for provenance and traceability within the Meta-Universe ecosystem.

The objective is to ensure that every significant semantic fact can be understood, verified, audited and trusted throughout its lifecycle.

---

# 2. Scope

This specification applies to:

- Meta-Models
- Objects
- Properties
- Relationships
- Events
- Projections
- Contracts
- Federation activities

Traceability requirements apply regardless of implementation technology.

---

# 3. Guiding Principles

Every conforming Meta-Model SHALL preserve:

- provenance;
- ownership;
- evolution history;
- semantic dependencies;
- auditability.

Traceability SHALL be considered a first-class architectural concern.

---

# 4. Provenance

Every significant semantic fact SHALL declare its provenance.

At minimum, provenance SHOULD identify:

- origin;
- creator;
- creation time;
- source universe;
- confidence (when applicable).

Unknown provenance SHALL be explicitly indicated.

---

# 5. Semantic Lineage

Provenance records *where a fact came from*. **Semantic Lineage** is broader: it records the **history of the origin of meaning** — the chain of facts, sources and derivations through which a conclusion became true. Every derived semantic fact SHOULD carry its Semantic Lineage so that its meaning can be reconstructed, not merely its authorship.

A lineage is a directed chain (more generally, a graph) from a conclusion back to the source observations that justify it. For example:

```text
Employee Competency Score
        ⟵ derived from  Performance Reviews
                ⟵ derived from  Project Feedback
                        ⟵ derived from  Sprint Retrospectives
```

Given Semantic Lineage, an AI agent SHALL be able to answer, for any significant derived fact:

- **Why is this true?** — the reasoning or rule that produced it;
- **On what facts is it based?** — the immediate inputs to that reasoning;
- **Which source objects influenced it?** — the originating Objects, Events and Relationships, transitively;
- **What stops being correct if a source changes?** — the downstream facts whose meaning depends on the source.

Semantic Lineage builds directly on the [Event](../04-core-concepts/Event.md) primitive, since each derivation step SHOULD be expressed as an immutable, traceable Event, and on [Dependency Traceability](#11-dependency-traceability) for forward and backward impact. Lineage links SHALL remain explicit and SHALL NOT be silently broken when sources evolve; a change in a source SHALL be expressible as a new lineage event rather than a destructive rewrite.

Taken together across a Meta-Model, Semantic Lineage turns the Meta-Universe into a **semantic graph of knowledge provenance**: a navigable structure in which every conclusion is connected to the evidence that grounds it, and the consequences of any change can be traced forward and backward across federated universes.

---

# 6. Ownership Traceability

Ownership SHALL remain traceable throughout the lifecycle of every significant semantic fact.

Ownership history SHOULD preserve:

- initial owner;
- ownership transfers;
- stewardship changes;
- delegation events.

---

# 7. Version Traceability

Every versioned artifact SHALL preserve references to:

- previous version;
- successor (when available);
- migration guidance (if applicable).

Version history SHALL remain reconstructable.

---

# 8. Relationship Traceability

Relationships SHALL remain traceable independently from the objects they connect.

Relationship history SHOULD include:

- creation;
- modification;
- termination;
- reason.

---

# 9. Event Traceability

Events SHALL be immutable.

Every event SHOULD preserve:

- identifier;
- timestamp;
- originating actor;
- originating universe;
- affected objects;
- event type.

Events SHALL NOT be silently modified.

---

# 10. Projection Traceability

Every projection SHALL preserve a reference to its source object.

Projection metadata SHOULD identify:

- originating object;
- originating universe;
- projection profile;
- creation time;
- purpose;
- disclosure contract (if applicable).

---

# 11. Dependency Traceability

Dependencies between semantic artifacts SHALL remain explicit.

A conforming implementation SHOULD be able to determine:

- what depends on a concept;
- what a concept depends upon;
- potential impact of semantic changes.

---

# 12. Federation Traceability

Federated interactions SHALL preserve traceability across universes.

Federation history SHOULD identify:

- participating universes;
- federation contract;
- exchanged projections;
- synchronization events;
- semantic mappings.

---

# 13. Auditability

Every significant semantic action SHOULD remain auditable.

Audit records SHOULD support reconstruction of:

- who performed an action;
- when it occurred;
- why it occurred (when available);
- under which contract or authority it occurred.

---

# 14. Historical Preservation

Historical semantic information SHOULD remain available even after objects evolve.

Historical records SHALL NOT be silently rewritten.

Corrections SHOULD be represented as new traceable events rather than destructive updates.

---

# 15. Architectural Invariants

Traceability SHALL NEVER compromise:

- constitutional principles;
- ownership;
- semantic identity;
- federation sovereignty.

Conversely, federation SHALL NEVER remove traceability.

---

# 16. Minimum Traceability Metadata

Every significant artifact SHOULD expose, directly or indirectly:

- identifier;
- owner;
- provenance;
- creation timestamp;
- last modification timestamp;
- version;
- lifecycle state;
- originating universe.

Additional metadata MAY be defined by domain-specific Meta-Models.

---

# 17. Future Directions

Semantic Lineage is introduced here as a concept within Traceability, but its reach extends well beyond audit and provenance: it underpins explainability, trust scoring, impact analysis and automated invalidation of stale conclusions. A future revision may therefore promote Semantic Lineage to its **own document**, defining a lineage graph model, query operations ("explain", "what-changes-if", "trace-to-source"), and the way lineage interacts with the [Semantic Fingerprint](Versioning.md) so that a source change can be detected and its downstream meaning re-evaluated automatically across a federation. That document would treat the knowledge-provenance graph as a first-class, queryable artifact of the Meta-Universe.

---

# Final Statement

Traceability is not merely an audit mechanism.

Within Meta-Universe it is a constitutional property of semantic knowledge, enabling trust, accountability, interoperability and long-term evolution across federated semantic universes.
