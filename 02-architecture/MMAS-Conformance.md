# 1. Purpose

This document defines the conformance model for the Meta-Model Architecture Standard (MMAS).

While the Meta-Universe Constitution (MUC) establishes constitutional compliance, MMAS defines architectural compliance. Conformance demonstrates that a Meta-Model follows the architectural principles, structure and packaging rules required for interoperability within the Meta-Universe ecosystem.

---

# 2. Scope

This specification applies to:

- Meta-Models
- Meta-Model repositories
- Semantic packages
- Bundles
- Layers
- Reference implementations
- Certification processes

---

# 3. Conformance Axes

Conformance within Meta-Universe is evaluated along **three independent axes**, one per standard. A Meta-Model is positioned on each axis separately; strength on one axis does not imply strength on another.

| Axis | Standard | Evaluates |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **MUC** | Meta-Universe Constitution | Constitutional compliance |
| **MMAS** | Meta-Model Architecture Standard | Architectural compliance |
| **MUFP** | Meta-Universe Federation Protocol | Federation capability |

The MMAS Conformance Levels defined in this document measure the **MMAS axis** only. A Meta-Model MAY conform to MUC while providing only partial MMAS support, and a high MMAS level does not by itself grant MUFP federation capability.

---

# 4. MMAS Conformance Levels

## Level A1 — Structured

The Meta-Model:

- defines a repository structure;
- exposes a manifest;
- uses stable identifiers;
- follows naming conventions;
- declares version information.

This level demonstrates basic architectural organization.

---

## Level A2 — Architectural

In addition to A1, the Meta-Model:

- organizes concepts into Bundles and Layers;
- defines Objects, Relationships and Properties consistently;
- preserves traceability;
- documents semantic dependencies.

---

## Level A3 — Extensible

In addition to A2, the Meta-Model:

- supports external model imports;
- supports semantic mappings;
- supports extension without modification;
- preserves imported ownership and provenance.

---

## Level A4 — Validated

In addition to A3, the Meta-Model:

- successfully passes the validation levels defined in [Validation](Validation.md) (V0 through the applicable upper level, V1–V5);
- publishes validation reports;
- declares compatibility statements;
- documents migration strategy.

The validation levels referenced by A4 are normatively defined in [Validation](Validation.md); this level requires demonstrated, reported conformance to them rather than self-assertion.

---

## Level A5 — AI-Native

In addition to A4, the Meta-Model:

- is fully machine-readable;
- supports automated discovery;
- exposes semantic metadata for AI agents;
- supports deterministic navigation;
- is suitable for autonomous reasoning and federation.

This represents the highest architectural maturity defined by MMAS.

---

# 5. Mandatory Requirements

Regardless of level, every MMAS-conforming Meta-Model SHALL:

- conform to the applicable MUC version;
- declare its MMAS version;
- expose a public schema;
- preserve semantic identity;
- preserve ownership;
- preserve provenance;
- preserve traceability.

---

# 6. Conformance Statement

Every Meta-Model SHOULD publish a Conformance Statement.

Recommended fields include:

- Meta-Model name;
- Meta-Model version;
- MUC version;
- MMAS version;
- MMAS Conformance Level;
- Validation level achieved;
- Imported standards;
- Supported federation profiles;
- Semantic fingerprint (optional).

---

# 7. Evidence

Architectural conformance SHOULD be supported by objective evidence such as:

- repository inspection;
- manifests;
- validation reports;
- dependency analysis;
- semantic mappings;
- package metadata.

Self-declaration MAY be used but SHOULD be distinguishable from independently verified certification.

---

# 8. Certification

Certification MAY verify MMAS conformance.

Certification SHOULD evaluate:

- repository organization;
- architectural consistency;
- validation results;
- documentation quality;
- interoperability readiness.

Certification procedures are ecosystem-specific and are outside the scope of this specification.

---

# 9. Evolution

A Meta-Model MAY improve its MMAS level over time.

Regression to a lower level SHOULD be explicitly documented.

Changes affecting conformance SHALL be reflected in the published Conformance Statement.

---

# 10. Loss of Conformance

A Meta-Model SHALL lose MMAS conformance if it:

- violates mandatory architectural requirements;
- no longer satisfies the declared level;
- intentionally contradicts MMAS-Core.

Loss of conformance SHALL be documented and versioned.

---

# 11. Future Directions

The three conformance axes — MUC, MMAS and MUFP — evaluate whether a Meta-Model is constitutionally sound, architecturally well-formed and federation-capable. None of them evaluates the **quality of the knowledge the model actually contains**. Two Meta-Models may both reach Level A5 yet differ profoundly in depth, accuracy and trustworthiness.

A future direction is therefore a **fourth axis, "Knowledge Quality"**, formalized as a **Meta-Model Quality Standard (MMQS)**. Where MMAS asks "is this model built correctly?", MMQS would ask "is this model good?" — evaluating the *content* rather than the architecture, across dimensions such as:

- **completeness** — how fully the domain is covered;
- **level of detail** — the granularity of the modelled concepts;
- **internal consistency** — absence of contradictions among facts;
- **mapping quality** — the fidelity of mappings to imported standards;
- **documentation** — the clarity and sufficiency of explanatory material;
- **data trust** — the reliability of the sources behind the facts;
- **evidence** — the strength of justification, linked through Semantic Lineage;
- **freshness** — how current the knowledge is.

Under MMQS, two models that are both A5 on the MMAS axis could still receive markedly different Knowledge Quality grades. MMQS would draw on the Semantic Lineage and Trust Vector concepts emerging elsewhere in the specification and would be reported alongside, but separately from, the architectural Conformance Level.

# Final Statement

MMAS Conformance Levels provide a common architectural maturity model for Meta-Models.

They enable organizations, AI agents and federation participants to objectively evaluate the architectural quality, interoperability and long-term maintainability of semantic models independently of their implementation technology.
