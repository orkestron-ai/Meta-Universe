# 1. Purpose

When a meta-model treats normative rules as binding law, two failures become
possible that ordinary tools miss:

1. Two changes each pass a line-level merge yet leave the rule set **logically
   contradictory** (a `git merge` understands lines, not logic).
2. At decision time, **Rule A requires X while Rule B forbids X** — a policy
   deadlock that sends a strict agent into an endless loop or a refusal to act.

This document defines how to keep a body of normative rules internally
consistent: a **pre-merge Policy Consistency Check**, explicit **rule
precedence**, and mandatory **deadlock handling with human escalation**.

It is distinct from [Conflict-Resolution](../03-federation/Conflict-Resolution.md):
that governs *divergent interpretations between sovereign universes*; this governs
*logical contradiction within one model's normative rules*.

# 2. Normative Rules as First-Class

A **Normative Rule** is a binding statement (`SHALL` / `SHALL NOT`) with a stable
identity. Each rule SHALL declare:

- a stable rule identifier;
- its **scope** (the objects/contexts it constrains);
- its **precedence** (an explicit weight or rank — see Section 4);
- its provenance and lifecycle.

Rules are versioned and traceable like any other semantic artifact.

---

# 3. Policy Consistency Check

Before a change to the normative base enters the [Model Canon](../05-reference-architecture/Reference-Repository.md),
a **Policy Consistency Check** SHALL be run. It evaluates whether the resulting
rule set is **satisfiable** — whether any state can satisfy all rules at once.

- A change that makes the rule set unsatisfiable SHALL be rejected as a
  **Constitutional (V3) failure** in [Validation](../02-architecture/Validation.md);
  the contradicting rules SHALL be reported by identifier.
- The check SHALL operate at the level of rule semantics (predicates over the
  model), not text. An implementation MAY use a logic solver or a validating
  reasoning agent; the requirement is that the verdict be **reproducible and
  explainable**.
- The check is a gate in the [Change Process](../01-constitution/Change-Process.md):
  no normative change merges until it passes.

This is the concrete, near-term form of the "AI Reasoning Validation" arm of the
future Semantic Validation Framework (see [Validation](../02-architecture/Validation.md)).

# 4. Rule Precedence

Where two rules *could* conflict in some states but a clear authority order
exists, **precedence** resolves it deterministically:

- Higher-precedence rules override lower ones; the resolution SHALL be recorded as
  a [traceable](../02-architecture/Traceability.md) decision, not applied silently.
- Constitutional rules ([MUC](../01-constitution/Meta-Universe-Constitution.md))
  SHALL have the highest precedence; no subordinate rule may override a
  constitutional article.
- Precedence resolves *prioritizable* conflicts. It SHALL NOT be used to paper
  over a genuine logical contradiction that no ordering can satisfy — that is a
  Section 3 failure.

---

# 5. Deadlock Detection and Exception Handling

A **policy deadlock** is a runtime state in which applicable rules cannot all be
satisfied and precedence does not resolve them (Rule A requires X, Rule B of equal
standing forbids X).

An implementation SHALL:

1. **Detect** the deadlock rather than loop — a reasoning agent SHALL bound its
   attempts and recognize mutual blockage.
2. **Record** the deadlock as an immutable [Event](../04-core-concepts/Event.md)
   (a `Conflict` event) naming the blocking rules.
3. **Escalate** immediately to a human (Human-in-the-Loop). The agent SHALL NOT
   silently pick a side, fabricate a resolution, or stall indefinitely.
4. **Halt** the affected action until the escalation is resolved; other,
   unaffected work MAY continue.

The resolution (a precedence change, a rule amendment, or a one-off exception)
SHALL itself pass the Policy Consistency Check before it takes effect.

---

# 6. Validation Hooks

- `V3` (Constitutional) is extended with a **Policy Consistency** check: the
  normative rule set SHALL be satisfiable.
- A model that cannot demonstrate satisfiability of its declared rules SHALL NOT
  claim V3 conformance.

See [Validation](../02-architecture/Validation.md) for the level definitions.

---

# 7. Architectural Invariants

- The normative rule set SHALL be satisfiable; contradictions SHALL be rejected
  before merge.
- Constitutional rules SHALL have the highest precedence.
- Precedence resolutions SHALL be recorded, never silent.
- A policy deadlock SHALL trigger detection, an Event, and human escalation —
  never an infinite loop or a silent choice.

---

# Future Directions

- A standard **predicate vocabulary** for expressing rule semantics so solvers
  interoperate.
- **Proof artifacts** attached to a passing consistency check, so a consumer can
  re-verify satisfiability without re-running the solver.
- Integration with [Simulated Sandbox Projections](../02-architecture/Simulation-Sandbox.md)
  to test a rule change for deadlocks before proposing it.

# Final Statement

> Rules that contradict each other are worse than no rules: they freeze the very
> agents meant to act on them. Policy Consistency keeps the law satisfiable — and
> when it cannot, hands the hard case to a human instead of looping forever.
