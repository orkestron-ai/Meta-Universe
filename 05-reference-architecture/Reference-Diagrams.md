# 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical reference diagrams recommended for Meta-Universe compliant specifications.

Reference diagrams provide standardized visual representations of architectural concepts. They improve consistency across repositories and enable both humans and AI systems to interpret architectural intent in a predictable manner.

---

# 2. Design Principles

Reference diagrams SHOULD be:

- semantically accurate;
- technology independent;
- simple;
- reusable;
- version-aware;
- traceable.

Diagrams SHALL illustrate semantic architecture rather than implementation details.

---

# 3. Canonical Diagram Set

A complete Meta-Universe specification SHOULD include diagrams for:

- Overall Architecture
- Meta-Universe Stack
- Core Concepts
- Federation Overview
- Identity Binding
- Projection Model
- Event Flow
- Lifecycle
- Interaction Patterns
- Federation Patterns
- Domain Meta-Model (when applicable)

---

# 4. Architecture Diagram

Purpose

Illustrates the relationship between:

- Foundation
- Architecture Standards
- Federation
- Core Concepts
- Domain Meta-Models
- Implementations

Recommended layout:

Foundation
    ↓
Architecture
    ↓
Federation
    ↓
Core Concepts
    ↓
Domain Meta-Models
    ↓
Implementations

---

# 5. Stack Diagram

Illustrates architectural layers and dependency direction.

Dependencies SHALL always point toward lower layers.

Implementations
    ↓
Federation Profiles

# 6. Federation Diagram

Illustrates cooperation between sovereign Universes.

Recommended elements:

- Universe A
- Universe B
- Trust
- Federation Contract
- Identity Binding
- Semantic Mapping
- Projection Exchange
- Events

Ownership SHALL remain within each Universe.

---

# 7. Projection Diagram

Recommended structure:

Meta-Object
      │
      ├── Public Projection
      ├── Internal Projection
      ├── AI Projection
      └── Partner Projection

Each Projection SHALL reference the same canonical Identity.

---

# 8. Identity Binding Diagram

Illustrates canonical identity linked to multiple local identities.

Canonical Identity
        │
 ┌──────┼──────┐
 │      │      │
Local A Local B Local C

Bindings SHALL preserve semantic authority.

---

# 9. Event Flow Diagram

Illustrates immutable semantic evolution.

Meta-Object
      │
Created Event
      │
Updated Event
      │
Approved Event
      │
Archived Event

State SHALL be explainable through Events.

---

# 10. Lifecycle Diagram

Recommended lifecycle:

Created
 ↓
Draft
 ↓
Proposed
 ↓
Active
 ↓
Deprecated
 ↓
Archived
 ↓
Retired

Optional states MAY be inserted without changing lifecycle semantics.

---

# 11. Interaction Diagram

Illustrates canonical interaction:

Discovery
 ↓
Trust
 ↓
Contract
 ↓
Projection
 ↓
Processing
 ↓
Events
 ↓
Synchronization

---

# 12. Domain Meta-Model Diagram

Domain diagrams SHOULD include:

- Namespaces;
- Objects;
- Relationships;
- Events;
- Contracts;
- Projections.

Implementation details SHOULD be omitted.

---

# 13. Diagram Conventions

Recommended conventions:

- Rectangles for semantic artifacts.
- Rounded rectangles for processes.
- Solid arrows for semantic relationships.
- Dashed arrows for references.
- Double borders for authoritative elements.

Visual style SHOULD remain consistent throughout a repository.

---

# 14. Validation

Reference diagrams SHOULD be reviewed for:

- semantic correctness;
- consistency with normative documents;
- terminology consistency;
- architectural completeness;
- version compatibility.

Diagrams SHALL complement textual specifications.

---

# 15. Architectural Invariants

Reference diagrams SHALL:

- preserve constitutional principles;
- preserve semantic authority;
- remain implementation independent;
- avoid technology-specific notation unless explicitly required.

---

# 16. Meta-Universe Diagram Language (MUDL)

The diagrams above standardize the *meaning* of Meta-Universe pictures, but not yet their *machine-readable form*: today a diagram's intent is canonical while its rendering is hand-drawn. The **Meta-Universe Diagram Language (MUDL)** closes this gap by standardizing a machine-readable representation of diagrams, so that a diagram becomes just another Projection of the meta-model rather than a separate, hand-maintained artifact.

MUDL defines:

- **Node types** — the semantic elements a diagram may contain:
  - Universe
  - Namespace
  - Object
  - Projection
  - Contract
  - Event

- **Edge types** — the semantic connections between nodes:
  - `owns`
  - `projects`
  - `binds`
  - `governs`
  - `mapsTo`
  - `synchronizes`
  - `federatesWith`

- **Visual notation** — the canonical shapes, borders and arrow styles (consistent with the Diagram Conventions in Section 13) that each node and edge type renders to.

- **Serialization** — a YAML/JSON encoding so a diagram can be authored, versioned, validated and diffed as structured data.

- **Generation** — deterministic rendering of that serialization to SVG, Mermaid or PlantUML, so the same source produces the same picture across tools.

A minimal MUDL example:

```yaml
mudl: 1.0
nodes:
  - id: u_acme
    type: Universe
    label: "Acme Corp"
  - id: emp_employee
    type: Object
    label: "Employee"
  - id: emp_public
    type: Projection
    label: "EmployeePublicProjection"
edges:
  - from: u_acme
    to: emp_employee
    type: owns
  - from: emp_employee
    to: emp_public
    type: projects
```

Because a MUDL document is generated from — and validated against — the underlying model, the diagram is a true Projection: it cannot drift from the semantics it depicts. MUDL plays a role for the Meta-Universe analogous to BPMN for processes, UML for software, or ArchiMate for enterprise architecture — a dedicated, standardized visual language, but one whose source of truth is the semantic meta-model itself.

---

# Future Directions

**MUDL** is expected to mature into a standalone informative specification covering the full node and edge vocabulary, the canonical visual notation, the YAML/JSON schema, and conformant generators to SVG, Mermaid and PlantUML. Its defining property is that a diagram becomes another Projection of the meta-model — authored as data, validated for conformance, and rendered deterministically — so that visual documentation across thousands of repositories stays consistent and always in step with the models it illustrates.

---

# Final Statement

Reference Diagrams provide a shared visual language for the Meta-Universe.

By standardizing the representation of architectural concepts, federation mechanisms and semantic structures, these diagrams improve understanding, interoperability and long-term maintainability while ensuring that visual documentation evolves consistently with the normative specifications.
