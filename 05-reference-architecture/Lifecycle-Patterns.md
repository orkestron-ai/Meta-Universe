# 1. Purpose

This document defines canonical Lifecycle Patterns for semantic artifacts within the Meta-Universe.

Lifecycle Patterns describe reusable scenarios for how semantic artifacts evolve over time while preserving identity, provenance, ownership, traceability and constitutional compliance.

These patterns complement the Lifecycle core concept by illustrating common lifecycle behaviors across different domains.

# 1a. Five Aspects of the Reference Architecture

With Lifecycle Patterns in place, the Reference Architecture section now describes the system from five complementary aspects:

- **Structure** — the [Architecture](Architecture.md): which components exist and how they fit together.
- **Layers** — the [Stack](Meta-Universe-Stack.md): the levels of abstraction and their dependencies.
- **Behaviour** — the [Interaction Patterns](Interaction-Patterns.md): how participants act over the course of a collaboration.
- **Topology** — the [Federation Patterns](Federation-Patterns.md): the forms of cooperation and the shape of the ecosystem.
- **Time** — the Lifecycle Patterns (this document): how semantic artifacts come into being, evolve and retire.

The first four aspects describe the system *in space* — its parts, layers, behaviours and topology at a given moment. Lifecycle Patterns add the missing dimension: the system *in time*. For long-lived semantic ecosystems — which are expected to evolve for years or decades while preserving identity, provenance and historical truth — describing the system in time is as essential as describing it in space. A model that only captures structure cannot explain how a Meta-Object, a Contract or a Federation came to be what it is, or how it will change without breaking history.

# 2. Scope

This specification applies to lifecycle management of:

- Meta-Objects;
- Relationships;
- Events;
- Contracts;
- Projections;
- Semantic Packages;
- Meta-Models;
- Federation relationships.

---

# 3. Design Principles

Every Lifecycle Pattern SHALL be:

- event-driven;
- traceable;
- identity-preserving;
- version-aware;
- technology independent;
- constitutionally compliant.

Lifecycle SHALL describe semantic evolution rather than implementation state.

---

# 4. Canonical Lifecycle Pattern

A typical lifecycle follows:

1. Create
2. Draft (optional)
3. Review
4. Approve
5. Publish
6. Active Operation
7. Evolution
8. Deprecation (optional)
9. Archive
10. Retire

Every transition SHOULD be represented by one or more Events.

---

# 5. Pattern: Meta-Object Lifecycle

Typical flow:

- Identity creation
- Initial metadata
- Activation
- Relationship evolution
- Projection generation
- Historical preservation
- Retirement

Canonical Identity SHALL remain unchanged.

---

# 6. Pattern: Semantic Contract Lifecycle

Typical flow:

- Draft
- Negotiation
- Approval
- Active
- Amendment
- Suspension (optional)
- Expiration
- Archive

Historical obligations SHALL remain traceable.

---

# 7. Pattern: Projection Lifecycle

Typical flow:

- Projection request
- Context evaluation
- Contract validation
- Projection generation
- Distribution
- Synchronization
- Withdrawal
- Archive

The underlying Meta-Object SHALL remain authoritative.

---

# 8. Pattern: Meta-Model Lifecycle

Typical flow:

- Design
- Validation
- Publication
- Adoption
- Evolution
- Major version transition
- Legacy support
- Retirement

Version history SHALL remain reconstructable.

---

# 9. Pattern: Federation Lifecycle

Federation lifecycle SHALL follow the Federation Lifecycle specification.

Typical phases include:

- Discovery
- Establishment
- Active Federation
- Evolution
- Suspension
- Termination
- Historical Preservation

---

# 10. Pattern: AI Agent Lifecycle

Illustrative flow:

- Registration
- Capability declaration
- Certification (optional)
- Active operation
- Skill evolution
- Contract participation
- Retirement

Agent identity SHALL remain stable throughout its lifecycle.

---

# 11. Pattern: Employee Lifecycle

Illustrative flow:

- Candidate
- Onboarding
- Active employment
- Role evolution
- Leave (optional)
- Offboarding
- Alumni
- Archive

Employment history SHALL remain traceable.

---

# 12. Cross-Cutting Capabilities

Every lifecycle pattern SHALL preserve:

- canonical Identity;
- provenance;
- Events;
- ownership;
- Contracts;
- Context;
- traceability.

---

# 13. Validation

Implementations SHOULD validate:

- lifecycle state;
- permitted transitions;
- governing Contracts;
- version compatibility;
- Event completeness;
- historical consistency.

Validation SHALL occur before lifecycle transitions are committed.

---

# 14. Architectural Invariants

Every Lifecycle Pattern SHALL preserve:

- constitutional compliance;
- semantic sovereignty;
- historical integrity;
- explainability;
- canonical Identity.

Lifecycle evolution SHALL never redefine historical truth.

---

# Final Statement

Lifecycle Patterns provide reusable reference scenarios for the evolution of semantic artifacts across the Meta-Universe.

By standardizing common lifecycle behaviors while preserving constitutional principles, Meta-Universe enables organizations, AI agents and semantic ecosystems to evolve consistently, transparently and interoperably over long periods without sacrificing identity, provenance or historical continuity.
