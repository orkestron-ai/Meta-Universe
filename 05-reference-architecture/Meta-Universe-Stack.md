# 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical layered architecture (Meta-Universe Stack).

The stack separates responsibilities into independent layers with well-defined dependencies, enabling long-term evolution without compromising interoperability or constitutional consistency.

---

# 1a. Architecture vs. Stack

The Reference Architecture section uses two complementary documents that are easy to confuse:

- **Architecture** (the [Overall Architecture](Architecture.md)) describes the *logical architecture*: which components exist and how they interact. It answers "what are the parts of the system, and how do they relate?"
- **Meta-Universe Stack** (this document) describes the *architectural stack*: the levels of abstraction and their dependencies. It answers "what are the layers, what does each layer depend on, and in which direction does dependency flow?"

This is the same distinction familiar from other foundational stacks. OSI and TCP/IP describe networking as layers of abstraction, each depending on the one below. Kubernetes is described as a stack of abstraction levels (containers, pods, controllers, cluster). ISO families layer standards so that higher standards build on lower ones. The Meta-Universe Stack plays exactly this role for semantic ecosystems.

Because the stack is the clearest one-picture summary of the whole ecosystem, it is likely one of the most-cited documents in the family — typically appearing on the first slides of white papers and in architecture overviews, where a single layered diagram communicates the entire shape of the Meta-Universe before any detail is introduced.

# 2. Design Principles

The Meta-Universe Stack SHALL:

- separate concerns;
- minimize coupling;
- maximize reuse;
- support independent evolution;
- remain technology independent;
- preserve constitutional compatibility.

Each layer SHALL depend only on lower architectural layers.

---

# 3. Canonical Stack

## Layer 0 — Foundation

Purpose:
Establish the philosophy and constitutional principles.

Includes:

- Vision
- Principles
- Terminology
- Glossary
- Meta-Universe Constitution (MUC)

---

## Layer 1 — Architecture Standards

Purpose:
Define how Meta-Models are designed.

Includes:

- MMAS Core
- Versioning
- Naming
- Traceability
- Validation
- Extension Model
- Package Structure
- MMAS Conformance

---

## Layer 2 — Federation

Purpose:
Enable semantic interoperability between sovereign Universes.

Includes:

- MUFP
- Trust Model
- Identity Binding
- Federation Contracts
- Consent & Disclosure
- Semantic Mapping
- Synchronization
- Conflict Resolution
- Federation Lifecycle
- Federation Profiles

---

## Layer 3 — Core Concepts

Purpose:
Provide the shared semantic vocabulary.

Includes:

- Universe
- Dimension
- Namespace
- Identity
- Object
- Relationship
- Event
- Contract
- Projection
- Context
- Lifecycle

---

## Layer 4 — Domain Meta-Models

Purpose:
Describe concrete business and technical domains.

Examples:

- Employee
- Organization
- Product
- Customer
- Software
- Infrastructure
- AI Agent
- Digital Twin
- Government
- Healthcare

---

## Layer 5 — Federation Profiles

Purpose:
Standardize federation practices for specific industries or communities.

Examples:

- Enterprise Profile
- HR Profile
- Healthcare Profile
- Government Profile
- Financial Profile
- AI Agent Profile
- IoT Profile

---

## Layer 6 — Implementations

Purpose:
Real-world systems implementing Meta-Universe.

Examples:

- Enterprise platforms
- AI orchestration systems
- Knowledge graphs
- Digital twins
- Public registries
- Multi-agent systems

---

# 4. Dependency Rules

Layers SHALL only depend downward.

Implementations
    ↓
Federation Profiles
    ↓
Domain Meta-Models
    ↓
Core Concepts
    ↓
Federation
    ↓
Architecture Standards
    ↓
Foundation

Higher layers SHALL NOT redefine lower-layer concepts.

---

# 5. Cross-Cutting Capabilities

The following capabilities span all layers:

- Identity
- Versioning
- Traceability
- Governance
- Security
- Trust
- Validation
- Provenance

These capabilities SHALL remain consistent throughout the stack.

---

# 6. Evolution

Each layer MAY evolve independently.

Evolution SHALL preserve:

- compatibility contracts;
- constitutional compliance;
- traceability;
- semantic consistency.

Breaking changes SHALL follow the Meta-Universe Change Process.

---

# 7. Reference Implementations

Conforming implementations MAY implement:

- individual layers;
- multiple adjacent layers;
- the complete stack.

Partial implementations SHALL explicitly declare supported layers.

---

# 8. Architectural Benefits

The layered stack enables:

- modular evolution;
- reusable standards;
- domain independence;
- explainable interoperability;
- AI-native architectures;
- long-term maintainability.

---

# 9. Architectural Invariants

Every conforming stack SHALL preserve:

- constitutional authority;
- semantic sovereignty;
- canonical identity;
- explicit contracts;
- traceability;
- projection-based federation.

No implementation SHALL bypass lower-layer guarantees.

---

# Future Directions

Because the stack diagram is so heavily cited, a future *canonical stack visualization* — expressed in the Meta-Universe Diagram Language (MUDL) — would let the layered picture be generated directly from the meta-model, so that white papers, slides and architecture overviews always render an accurate, version-aware view of the layers and their dependencies rather than a hand-drawn approximation.

---

# Final Statement

The Meta-Universe Stack defines the canonical layering of the Meta-Universe ecosystem.

By separating constitutional principles, architectural standards, federation mechanisms, shared semantic concepts, domain knowledge and implementations into independent layers, the stack provides a scalable foundation for interoperable semantic ecosystems that can evolve for decades while preserving trust, consistency and semantic integrity.
