# 1. Purpose

This document defines the recommended repository structure for Meta-Universe compliant specifications, domain Meta-Models and semantic packages.

The Reference Repository provides a common organizational model that improves discoverability, interoperability, governance and long-term maintainability.

The structure is recommended as a reference architecture but may be adapted where justified without violating MUC, MMAS or MUFP.

# 1a. Meta-Universe as a Standard of Knowledge Publication

The Meta-Universe is not only a way to *build* semantic models; it is also a standard for *publishing* them. The family of standards divides this responsibility cleanly:

- **MMAS** defines *how to build* models — their architecture, versioning and validation.
- **MUC** defines *the laws* every model and exchange obeys.
- **MUFP** defines *how models interact* across sovereign Universes.
- **The Reference Repository** (this document) defines *how models are published* — the common organizational form in which knowledge is made discoverable, verifiable and federatable.

This mirrors how other ecosystems separate creation from publication. Git stores history; GitHub publishes code. OpenAPI publishes APIs. OCI publishes containers. In the same spirit, **the Meta-Universe publishes semantic models** — and the Reference Repository is the canonical layout that makes a published model recognizable to any human or AI agent that encounters it.

A repository organized this way is itself a kind of Projection of the knowledge it contains: a predictable surface that exposes foundation, architecture, federation, core concepts, domain models and guides in known locations, with known metadata, so that consumers can navigate, validate and federate without prior arrangement.

---

# 2. Design Principles

A conforming repository SHOULD be:

- human-readable;
- AI-readable;
- Git-native;
- modular;
- versioned;
- traceable;
- extensible.

Repository organization SHALL favor semantic clarity over implementation convenience.

---

# 3. Canonical Repository Structure

Recommended top-level structure:

```
Repository/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── archive/
├── 00-foundation/
├── 01-constitution/
├── 02-architecture/
├── 03-federation/
├── 04-core-concepts/
├── 05-reference-architecture/
├── 06-domain-models/
├── 07-guides/
├── examples/
└── schemas/ (optional)
```

Additional directories MAY be introduced provided they do not change the semantic meaning of the repository.

---

# 4. Folder Responsibilities

**archive/**

Contains historical versions retained for traceability.

**00-foundation/**

Vision, principles, terminology and glossary.

**01-constitution/**

Normative constitutional documents.

**02-architecture/**

Architecture standards (MMAS).

**03-federation/**

Federation protocol specifications (MUFP).

**04-core-concepts/**

Foundational semantic concepts.

**05-reference-architecture/**

Reference architectures and architectural patterns.

**06-domain-models/**

Reusable domain Meta-Models.

**07-guides/**

Informative implementation and migration guidance.

**examples/**

Illustrative examples demonstrating correct application of the standards.

# 5. Document Requirements

Every normative document SHOULD define:

- document identifier;
- title;
- version;
- status;
- classification;
- purpose;
- final statement.

Documents SHOULD remain independently understandable.

---

# 6. Naming Conventions

Repository naming SHOULD follow MMAS Naming Conventions.

Files SHOULD:

- use descriptive names;
- avoid ambiguity;
- remain stable across versions.

Normative filenames SHOULD NOT include version numbers.

---

# 7. Versioning

Repository evolution SHALL follow semantic versioning.

Historical releases SHOULD remain available.

Breaking structural changes SHALL accompany a new major version.

---

# 8. Traceability

Repository artifacts SHALL preserve:

- provenance;
- authorship;
- version history;
- document lineage;
- related standards.

Traceability SHALL extend across repository history.

---

# 9. Extensibility

Repositories MAY include:

- schemas;
- contracts;
- templates;
- validation assets;
- generated artifacts;
- automation resources.

Extensions SHALL remain semantically compatible with the reference structure.

---

# 10. Validation

A conforming repository SHOULD validate:

- required folders;
- required metadata;
- document identifiers;
- naming consistency;
- version consistency;
- cross-document references.

Validation SHOULD be automatable.

---

# 11. Governance

Every repository SHALL identify:

- governing authority;
- publication process;
- supported standard versions;
- conformance level.

Governance SHALL remain transparent.

---

# 12. Architectural Invariants

A conforming repository SHALL preserve:

- constitutional compliance;
- semantic organization;
- traceability;
- modularity;
- long-term maintainability.

Repository structure SHALL support semantic evolution without sacrificing historical integrity.

---

# Future Directions

The Reference Repository describes how a single repository is laid out. The natural next step is a **Meta-Universe Registry Specification** that describes how repositories are *discovered and verified at scale*, forming a Federation of Registries. Such a specification would let AI agents:

- auto-discover Meta-Universe repositories from a well-known registry entry point;
- detect which MUC, MMAS and MUFP versions each repository supports;
- verify conformance (required folders, metadata, identifiers, naming and cross-references) automatically;
- and, on that basis, build federation between repositories without manual configuration.

Where the Reference Repository makes a single published model recognizable, the Registry Specification would make the *whole ecosystem of models* navigable — the difference between a single published API and an index of all published APIs an agent can query, validate and connect to on its own.

---

# Final Statement

The Reference Repository defines the canonical organization for Meta-Universe standards and Meta-Models.

By adopting a common repository structure, publishers enable humans and AI agents to discover, understand, validate and evolve semantic knowledge consistently across independent repositories while preserving governance, traceability and interoperability throughout the Meta-Universe ecosystem.
