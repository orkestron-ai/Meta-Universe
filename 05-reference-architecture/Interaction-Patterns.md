# 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical interaction patterns used throughout the Meta-Universe.

Interaction Patterns describe repeatable semantic collaboration scenarios between sovereign Universes, AI agents, organizations and semantic systems. They provide implementation-independent reference workflows built upon MUC, MMAS and MUFP.

# 1a. Interaction Patterns as the Design Patterns of Semantic Federation

Interaction Patterns are, for semantic federation, what *Design Patterns* are for object-oriented software: named, reusable solutions to recurring collaboration problems. They do not introduce new primitives; they describe proven ways to combine the existing ones.

This is one of four complementary views of the Reference Architecture:

- **Core Concepts** are the *vocabulary and types* — the nouns of the system (Object, Relationship, Event, Contract, Projection, Context).
- **Architecture** is the *system structure* — which components exist and how they fit together.
- **Stack** is the *abstraction levels* — the layers and their dependencies.
- **Interaction Patterns** are the *typical behaviours* — the recurring ways participants act, the verbs of the system.

Just as a developer reaches for "Observer" or "Strategy" rather than reinventing a solution, an architect of a semantic ecosystem reaches for a named Interaction Pattern — Semantic Discovery, Knowledge Request, Cross-Universe Identity Resolution — to solve a recurring federation problem in a predictable, explainable way.

# 2. Scope

This specification applies to interactions involving:

- Universes;
- Dimensions;
- Namespaces;
- Meta-Objects;
- Projections;
- Semantic Contracts;
- AI Agents;
- Federation Profiles.

---

# 3. Design Principles

Every interaction pattern SHALL be:

- purpose-driven;
- contract-governed;
- traceable;
- identity-preserving;
- context-aware;
- technology independent.

Patterns SHALL describe semantic behavior rather than communication protocols.

---

# 4. Canonical Interaction Lifecycle

Every interaction SHOULD follow these phases:

1. Discovery
2. Capability Declaration
3. Trust Evaluation
4. Contract Negotiation
5. Context Establishment
6. Projection Exchange
7. Semantic Processing
8. Event Recording
9. Synchronization (optional)
10. Completion or Continuation

Implementations MAY optimize the sequence while preserving semantic guarantees.

---

# 5. Pattern: Semantic Discovery

Goal:
Discover another Universe and understand its public semantic capabilities.

Typical sequence:

- Discover Universe
- Retrieve public metadata
- Discover Namespaces
- Retrieve public schemas
- Evaluate compatibility

No protected knowledge SHALL be exchanged.

---

# 6. Pattern: Knowledge Request

Goal:
Obtain semantic knowledge for a declared purpose.

Typical sequence:

- Declare purpose
- Establish trust
- Evaluate Contract
- Generate appropriate Projection
- Exchange Projection
- Record disclosure Event

Knowledge SHALL be disclosed through Projections.

---

# 7. Pattern: Cross-Universe Identity Resolution

Goal:
Determine whether two local identities represent the same Meta-Object.

Typical sequence:

- Resolve canonical identity
- Evaluate Identity Bindings
- Verify authority
- Record binding decision

Identity SHALL remain canonical.

---

# 8. Pattern: Semantic Synchronization

Goal:
Maintain semantically consistent Projections.

Typical sequence:

- Detect Event
- Evaluate synchronization scope
- Apply Semantic Mapping
- Synchronize Projection
- Detect drift
- Record synchronization Event

Synchronization SHALL preserve sovereignty.

---

# 9. Pattern: AI Agent Collaboration

Goal:
Enable multiple AI Agents from different Universes to cooperate.

Typical sequence:

- Discover capabilities
- Establish trust
- Negotiate Semantic Contract
- Exchange task-specific Projections
- Produce result
- Publish Events
- Preserve traceability

Agents SHALL exchange semantic knowledge rather than unrestricted internal state.

---

# 10. Pattern: Semantic Import

Goal:
Adopt concepts from external standards.

Typical sequence:

- Discover external model
- Import schema
- Preserve provenance
- Create Semantic Mappings
- Publish imported Namespace

Imported semantics SHALL remain identifiable.

---

# 11. Pattern: Conflict Resolution

Goal:
Resolve semantic disagreements.

Typical sequence:

- Detect conflict
- Classify conflict
- Evaluate authority
- Apply Contracts and mappings
- Escalate when necessary
- Record Resolution Event

Historical evidence SHALL be preserved.

---

# 12. Cross-Cutting Concerns

Every interaction SHALL preserve:

- canonical Identity;
- provenance;
- Context;
- governing Contracts;
- Event history;
- traceability.

---

# 13. Validation

Implementations SHOULD validate:

- purpose;
- trust;
- applicable Contracts;
- identity integrity;
- semantic consistency;
- version compatibility.

Validation SHALL precede semantic processing.

---

# 14. Architectural Invariants

Canonical interaction patterns SHALL preserve:

- semantic sovereignty;
- constitutional compliance;
- explicit consent;
- projection-based exchange;
- explainable decisions;
- historical integrity.

Patterns SHALL never bypass constitutional safeguards.

---

# Future Directions

The patterns above are a starting set. A future **Meta-Universe Pattern Catalog** would grow this into a curated, versioned library of interaction patterns — each with a name, intent, participants, sequence, invariants and worked example — so that architects and AI agents can select proven behaviours by name. Anticipated entries include:

- Agent Hiring
- Employee Onboarding
- Digital Identity Verification
- Organization Federation
- Semantic Package Publication
- Knowledge Marketplace
- AI-to-AI Collaboration
- Cross-Border Government Data Exchange

As with software design-pattern catalogs, the value lies in shared names and shared expectations: once a pattern is in the catalog, every participant understands how an interaction will unfold and which constitutional safeguards it preserves.

---

# Final Statement

Canonical Interaction Patterns provide reusable semantic workflows for the Meta-Universe ecosystem.

By standardizing how discovery, trust, contracts, projections, synchronization and AI collaboration are orchestrated, the Meta-Universe enables interoperable, explainable and technology-independent interaction across sovereign Universes while preserving identity, meaning and long-term semantic consistency.
