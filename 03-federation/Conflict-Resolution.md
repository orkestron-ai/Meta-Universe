# 1. Purpose

This document defines the principles for detecting, evaluating and resolving semantic conflicts within the Meta-Universe Federation Protocol (MUFP).

Conflict Resolution ensures that federated Universes can collaborate safely while preserving semantic sovereignty, canonical identity and constitutional compliance.

Resolution governs semantic disagreements rather than implementation failures.

A defining principle of this document is that a conflict is not an error to be hidden but a **semantic fact to be preserved**. The Meta-Universe records the conflict, gives it a lifecycle, resolves it through traceable Events, and keeps the fact that the conflict existed permanently in history.

---

# 2. Scope

This specification applies to:

- Identity Bindings;
- Semantic Mappings;
- Projection synchronization;
- Semantic Contracts;
- Version compatibility;
- Cross-Universe interactions.

---

# 3. Conflict Principles

Conflict handling SHALL be:

- explicit;
- traceable;
- explainable;
- reversible where practical;
- contract-governed;
- technology independent.

Conflicts SHALL NEVER be silently resolved.

---

# 4. Definition

A semantic conflict exists whenever two or more participating Universes cannot simultaneously satisfy an agreed semantic interpretation, contractual obligation or federation rule.

Conflict detection SHALL precede resolution.

---

# 4a. Conflict Preservation

A semantic conflict SHALL be treated as a **first-class lifecycle object**, not as a transient error to be discarded once resolved. This is the principle of **Conflict Preservation**: the conflict is recorded as a semantic fact, carried through an explicit lifecycle, and its existence is retained in history even after it is resolved.

The conflict lifecycle is:

```text
Semantic Conflict
   └── Detection Event
          └── Investigation
                 └── Resolution Decision
                        └── Resolution Event
                               └── Historical Trace
```

- **Semantic Conflict** — the conflict is recognized and recorded as a semantic fact with its own identity.
- **Detection Event** — a traceable Event marks when and how the conflict was detected.
- **Investigation** — the conflict is examined against authoritative sources, mappings and Contracts.
- **Resolution Decision** — a decision is reached and attributed to a responsible authority.
- **Resolution Event** — a traceable Event records the decision and its rationale.
- **Historical Trace** — the conflict, its investigation and its resolution remain permanently reconstructable.

Resolving a conflict SHALL NOT erase the fact that it occurred. The Historical Trace SHALL preserve the conflict's existence, its detection, the alternatives considered and the decision taken. This is essential for **AI agents reconciling divergent interpretations**: an agent must be able to see not only the current agreed meaning but the history of disagreement that produced it, so that past reconciliations are explainable and are not silently re-litigated.

Typical conflicts include:

- Identity conflicts;
- Version incompatibility;
- Semantic Mapping ambiguity;
- Projection inconsistency;
- Contract disagreement;
- Trust disagreement;
- Lifecycle mismatch;
- Synchronization drift.

Domain Meta-Models MAY define additional conflict categories.

---

# 6. Conflict Detection

Implementations SHOULD detect conflicts through:

- validation;
- synchronization;
- Event processing;
- version negotiation;
- contract evaluation;
- semantic reasoning.

Detected conflicts SHALL be recorded.

---

# 7. Resolution Strategy

Recommended resolution workflow:

1. Detect conflict.
2. Classify conflict.
3. Identify authoritative sources.
4. Evaluate Semantic Contracts.
5. Apply approved mapping or policy.
6. Escalate when automated resolution is not justified.
7. Record the Resolution Event.

Every step SHOULD remain auditable.

---

# 8. Authority

Resolution SHALL respect constitutional authority.

The authoritative Universe remains the source of truth for its own Meta-Objects.

No participant SHALL overwrite another Universe's authoritative semantics.

---

# 9. Escalation

If a conflict cannot be resolved deterministically, it SHOULD be escalated.

Escalation MAY involve:

- delegated stewards;
- governing organizations;
- standards authorities;
- human reviewers.

Escalation decisions SHALL be traceable.

---

# 10. Contracts

Semantic Contracts SHALL participate in conflict resolution.

Applicable Contracts MAY determine:

- precedence;
- disclosure limits;
- synchronization rules;
- acceptable mappings;
- dispute procedures.

---

# 11. Historical Integrity

Resolution SHALL preserve historical evidence.

Conflicts SHALL NOT be resolved by deleting:

- Events;
- historical mappings;
- previous versions;
- historical Contracts.

Corrections SHALL be represented by new traceable artifacts.

---

# 12. Traceability

Every conflict SHALL preserve:

- participating Universes;
- affected identities;
- conflict type;
- governing Contracts;
- resolution decision;
- timestamps;
- responsible authority.

---

# 13. Validation

Implementations SHOULD validate:

- conflict classification;
- authority;
- contract applicability;
- mapping consistency;
- version compatibility;
- traceability.

Validation SHALL be repeatable and deterministic.

---

# 14. Security Principles

Conflict handling SHALL preserve:

- least knowledge;
- explicit authorization;
- auditability;
- purpose limitation.

Conflict resolution SHALL NOT justify additional knowledge disclosure.

---

# 15. Architectural Invariants

Conflict Resolution SHALL preserve:

- constitutional compliance;
- semantic sovereignty;
- canonical identity;
- ownership;
- provenance;
- traceability.

Resolution SHALL restore semantic coherence without transferring semantic authority.

---

# 16. Future Directions

Conflict Preservation anticipates a companion specification on *automated reconciliation by AI agents*. That specification would define how an agent reads the Historical Trace of prior conflicts, weighs authoritative sources and Trust Vectors, proposes a Resolution Decision, and records its reasoning as a traceable Event — all while honouring the invariant that the existence of a conflict is never erased. It would also define a Semantic Conflict classification rich enough for agents to recognize recurring divergence patterns and avoid re-opening settled reconciliations.

---

# Final Statement

Conflict Resolution provides the governance mechanism that allows sovereign Universes to resolve semantic disagreements without sacrificing autonomy.

By combining constitutional authority, Semantic Contracts, explicit mappings, traceable Events and human escalation where necessary, the Meta-Universe enables long-term semantic interoperability while ensuring that every resolution remains explainable, auditable and reversible in principle.
