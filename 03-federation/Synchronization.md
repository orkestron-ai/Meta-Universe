# 1. Purpose

This document defines the principles of Projection Synchronization within the Meta-Universe Federation Protocol (MUFP).

Synchronization ensures that federated Universes maintain semantically consistent Projections while preserving sovereignty, ownership and constitutional authority. Synchronization governs the exchange of semantic changes, not ownership of Meta-Objects.

What MUFP performs is best understood as **Semantic Synchronization**, distinct from the data-centric mechanisms it is often confused with. MUFP synchronizes Projections, Identity Bindings, Semantic Mappings, Events and Contracts — never databases or internal state.

---

# 2. Scope

This specification applies to:

- Projection synchronization;
- Identity Bindings;
- Semantic Contracts;
- federated Meta-Objects;
- Relationships;
- Event Streams;
- Semantic Packages.

---

# 3. Synchronization Principles

Synchronization SHALL be:

- projection-based;
- event-driven whenever practical;
- traceable;
- contract-governed;
- version-aware;
- non-destructive;
- technology independent.

Synchronization SHALL NEVER transfer semantic authority.

---

# 4. Definition

Projection Synchronization is the controlled process of updating federated Projections to reflect changes in their authoritative Meta-Objects.

Synchronization SHALL preserve canonical Identity while allowing receiving Universes to maintain local operational representations.

---

# 4a. Three Kinds of Synchronization

The term "synchronization" conflates three distinct activities. MUFP performs only the third, and the distinction is normative:

- **Data Replication** — copying rows, documents or bytes from one store to another so that the stores hold identical data. The unit is the *record*; the goal is *identical copies*.
- **State Synchronization** — aligning the internal runtime state of two systems (caches, sessions, in-memory models) so that they behave consistently. The unit is *internal state*; the goal is *behavioural alignment*.
- **Semantic Synchronization (MUFP)** — keeping the *shared meaning* between sovereign Universes coherent. The unit is the *Projection, Identity Binding, Semantic Mapping, Event and Contract*; the goal is *coherent interpretation*, not identical storage.

MUFP SHALL synchronize Projections, Identity Bindings, Semantic Mappings, Events and Contracts. MUFP SHALL NOT replicate databases and SHALL NOT synchronize the internal operational state of participating systems. A receiving Universe's storage and runtime remain its own concern; only the agreed semantic surface is kept coherent.

---

# 4b. Semantic Coherence

Because MUFP synchronizes meaning rather than data, **Semantic Coherence** is arguably a more accurate name for what this document governs than "synchronization".

Semantic Coherence is the property of keeping the *independent interpretations of one semantic reality* consistent across sovereign Universes while preserving each Universe's autonomy. Coherence does not require that participants hold the same data, store it the same way, or interpret it identically in every respect — only that their interpretations of the *shared* meaning remain reconcilable and do not silently diverge.

Where this document says "synchronization", it SHALL be read as the pursuit of Semantic Coherence: a coherent, traceable, contract-governed alignment of shared meaning, not a convergence of stores or state.

---

# 5. Synchronization Model

The authoritative Universe SHALL remain the source of semantic truth.

Receiving Universes SHALL synchronize authorized Projections rather than maintaining independent authoritative copies.

Synchronization MAY be:

- one-way;
- bidirectional (through agreed Contracts);
- event-driven;
- scheduled;
- on-demand.

---

# 6. Synchronization Scope

Every synchronization process SHOULD define:

- participating Universes;
- participating Namespaces;
- Projection Profiles;
- synchronization direction;
- governing Contracts;
- synchronization frequency;
- synchronization boundaries.

Undefined scope SHALL NOT be assumed.

---

# 7. Synchronization Triggers

Synchronization MAY be initiated by:

- published Events;
- scheduled intervals;
- explicit requests;
- Contract changes;
- lifecycle transitions;
- version updates.

Triggers SHALL remain traceable.

---

# 8. Event-Based Synchronization

Events SHOULD be the preferred synchronization mechanism.

Event Streams MAY be used to:

- notify changes;
- reconstruct state;
- detect drift;
- replay historical evolution.

Receiving Universes SHOULD process Events in semantic order.

---

# 9. Drift Detection

Participating Universes SHOULD detect semantic drift.

Drift MAY result from:

- delayed synchronization;
- incompatible versions;
- expired Contracts;
- mapping changes;
- local operational modifications.

Detected drift SHALL be recorded and evaluated.

---

# 10. Conflict Resolution

Synchronization conflicts SHALL NOT be resolved implicitly.

Conflict resolution SHOULD consider:

- authoritative Universe;
- canonical Identity;
- governing Contracts;
- mapping rules;
- timestamps;
- semantic intent.

Manual escalation MAY be required.

---

# 11. Version Compatibility

Synchronization SHALL verify:

- MUC compatibility;
- MMAS compatibility;
- MUFP compatibility;
- Projection Profile compatibility;
- Mapping compatibility.

Incompatible synchronization SHALL be rejected or negotiated.

---

# 12. Traceability

Every synchronization activity SHALL preserve:

- synchronization Event;
- participating Universes;
- synchronized Projections;
- governing Contracts;
- timestamps;
- initiating actor or process.

Historical synchronization SHALL remain reconstructable.

---

# 13. Security Principles

Synchronization SHALL follow:

- least knowledge;
- explicit authorization;
- purpose limitation;
- Projection-based disclosure;
- auditable exchange.

Receiving Universes SHALL receive only the knowledge authorized by applicable Contracts.

---

# 14. Validation

Implementations SHOULD validate:

- Identity Bindings;
- Projection integrity;
- Contract applicability;
- synchronization scope;
- semantic consistency;
- drift status.

Validation SHALL precede synchronization.

---

# 15. Architectural Invariants

Projection Synchronization SHALL preserve:

- canonical Identity;
- semantic sovereignty;
- ownership;
- provenance;
- traceability;
- constitutional compliance.

Synchronization SHALL synchronize representations, not semantic authority.

---

# 16. Future Directions

The reframing of synchronization as **Semantic Coherence** anticipates a companion specification on *coherence measurement*: how divergence between independent interpretations is detected, quantified and bounded over the Semantic Timeline, and how acceptable coherence windows are declared in a Semantic Contract. Such a standard would let federations agree, explicitly, how coherent they must remain and how quickly drift must be reconciled, without ever obliging participants to replicate data or surrender autonomy.

---

# Final Statement

Projection Synchronization enables independent Universes to remain semantically aligned while preserving autonomy.

By synchronizing authorized Projections through Events, Identity Bindings, Semantic Contracts and explicit semantic mappings, the Meta-Universe provides a trustworthy mechanism for continuous federation without creating centralized ownership or duplicating semantic truth.
