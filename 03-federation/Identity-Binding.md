# 1. Purpose

This document defines how semantic identities are bound across sovereign Universes.

Identity Binding enables multiple Universes to recognize that different local representations refer to the same underlying semantic entity while preserving sovereignty, ownership and constitutional principles.

Identity Binding creates semantic equivalence rather than transferring ownership.

The core thesis of this specification is that **the Meta-Universe requires no single global identifier.** It requires something stronger and more durable: an explicit, verifiable and traceable *agreement* between identities. Each Universe keeps its own identifiers; no Universe is obliged to accept another's; shared identity arises only through Identity Binding, and every binding is versioned, traceable and governed by a Semantic Contract. This approach is more scalable than central catalogs or global identifier schemes, because it adds no point of universal coordination and no authority that every participant must defer to.

---

# 2. Scope

This specification applies to:

- Meta-Objects
- Relationships
- Projections
- Semantic Packages
- Imported Models
- Cross-Universe references

---

# 3. Architectural Principles

Identity Binding SHALL be:

- explicit;
- traceable;
- reversible;
- version-aware;
- contract-governed;
- technology independent.

Binding SHALL NOT modify canonical identities.

---

# 4. Canonical Identity

Every Meta-Object SHALL possess one canonical Identity within its authoritative Universe.

The authoritative Universe remains the source of truth for that identity.

Canonical identities SHALL remain immutable.

---

# 5. Local Identity

A participating Universe MAY assign a local identifier for operational purposes.

Local identifiers:

- SHALL remain local;
- SHALL reference the canonical identity;
- SHALL NOT replace the canonical identity;
- SHALL remain traceable.

---

# 6. Identity Binding

An Identity Binding is an explicit semantic mapping between:

- a canonical identity;
- one or more local identities.

Bindings SHALL identify:

- authoritative Universe;
- participating Universe;
- binding type;
- confidence (when applicable);
- governing Contract;
- creation Event.

---

# 6a. No Global Identifier — Agreement Instead

The Meta-Universe SHALL NOT depend on any universal identifier shared by all participants, and no Universe SHALL be required to adopt another Universe's identifiers as its own.

Instead:

- Each Universe SHALL retain sole authority over its own canonical identities.
- A Universe MAY decline to recognize any external identity; recognition is never automatic.
- Shared identity SHALL arise only through an explicit Identity Binding — a stated, mutual agreement that two identities refer to the same semantic entity.
- Every binding SHALL be versioned, traceable and governed by a Semantic Contract.

This is deliberately more scalable than a central catalog or a global identifier registry. A central catalog requires every participant to coordinate through, and trust, a single authority; it becomes a bottleneck, a single point of failure and a point of contested governance. Binding-by-agreement adds no such authority: a federation of *N* Universes does not require a shared *N*-wide namespace, only the specific bindings that the participants actually choose to establish. Identity therefore scales with cooperation, not with central administration.

Typical binding types include:

- Exact Identity
- Equivalent Identity
- Derived Identity
- Temporary Binding
- Historical Binding
- Alias

Domain standards MAY define additional types.

---

# 8. Establishment

Identity Binding SHOULD follow this sequence:

1. Discover canonical identity.
2. Verify authority.
3. Evaluate semantic equivalence.
4. Establish governing Contract.
5. Create binding.
6. Record binding Event.
7. Publish binding metadata (when permitted).

---

# 9. Identity Resolution

Conforming implementations SHOULD resolve:

- canonical identity;
- authoritative Universe;
- local identities;
- active bindings;
- historical bindings;
- applicable semantic mappings.

Resolution MAY require authorization.

---

# 10. Federation

Federated Universes SHALL exchange canonical identities whenever practical.

Where local identifiers are exchanged, corresponding Identity Bindings SHALL also be available.

Federation SHALL preserve identity continuity.

---

# 11. Evolution

Bindings MAY evolve.

Changes SHALL be represented through new Events.

Historical bindings SHALL remain reconstructable.

Retiring a binding SHALL NOT alter historical references.

---

# 12. Validation

Implementations SHOULD validate:

- identity uniqueness;
- authority;
- binding consistency;
- version compatibility;
- contract applicability;
- traceability.

Validation SHALL NOT silently rewrite bindings.

---

# 13. Security Principles

Identity Binding SHALL follow:

- least knowledge;
- explicit authorization;
- purpose-driven disclosure;
- auditable operations;
- revocable access where applicable.

Identity metadata MAY be disclosed independently from protected object data.

---

# 14. Architectural Invariants

Identity Binding SHALL preserve:

- canonical identity;
- semantic sovereignty;
- ownership;
- provenance;
- traceability;
- constitutional compliance.

Binding SHALL NEVER imply transfer of semantic authority.

---

# 15. Future Directions

The agreement-based identity model anticipates a **Federation of Registries**, in which bindings are not merely exchanged point-to-point but published into trust-anchored binding registries that participants may consult and cross-verify. Such registries would index Identity Bindings and their Semantic Lineage without ever becoming a global identifier authority — they catalog *agreements*, not *truths*. A future specification would define registry discovery, binding provenance and the revocation and supersession of published bindings while preserving the principle that no Universe is obliged to accept any binding it has not itself agreed to.

---

# Final Statement

Identity Binding is the constitutional mechanism that allows sovereign Universes to recognize shared semantic entities without creating a centralized identity registry.

By separating canonical identity from local operational identifiers and linking them through explicit, traceable agreements, Meta-Universe enables trustworthy federation while preserving autonomy, historical continuity and semantic integrity.
