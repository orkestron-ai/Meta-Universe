# 1. Purpose

This document defines the Meta-Universe Federation Protocol (MUFP), the normative framework governing semantic interoperability between sovereign Universes.

MUFP specifies how Universes discover one another, establish trust, negotiate capabilities, exchange knowledge and preserve constitutional principles during federation.

MUFP governs federation semantics rather than network protocols or implementation technologies.

MUFP federates **knowledge, not data**. It is an instrument of *semantic diplomacy* rather than data transport. Before any datum is exchanged, the participating Universes MUST first agree on what their concepts mean, whether they trust one another, under which rules knowledge may be used and for what purpose. Data movement, where it occurs at all, is the final and least significant step of a federation — a consequence of agreed meaning, never its precondition.

This stands in deliberate contrast to conventional integration protocols. REST, GraphQL, gRPC and OData answer only the question *"how do we transfer data?"* They presuppose that the meaning, trust, governance and purpose of that data have already been settled out of band. MUFP makes those concerns first-class and normative: it answers *"how do two sovereign semantic spaces come to understand and trust one another well enough to exchange knowledge safely?"*

---

# 2. Scope

MUFP applies to:

- Universes
- Dimensions (through their parent Universe)
- Namespaces
- Meta-Models
- Semantic Packages
- Projections
- Semantic Contracts
- Federation Profiles

---

# 3. Design Principles

Federation SHALL be:

- voluntary;
- contract-driven;
- purpose-driven;
- projection-based;
- traceable;
- version-aware;
- technology independent.

Federation SHALL NEVER transfer semantic sovereignty.

---

# 4. Constitutional Foundation

MUFP extends the Meta-Universe Constitution (MUC).

Every federated interaction SHALL preserve:

- sovereignty;
- canonical identity;
- ownership;
- provenance;
- traceability;
- semantic authority.

No federation activity SHALL violate constitutional principles.

---

# 5. Federation Model

Federation is an agreement between two or more sovereign Universes.

Each participating Universe remains authoritative for its own semantic knowledge.

Knowledge exchange SHALL occur through Projections governed by Semantic Contracts.

---

# 6. The Canonical Federation Sequence

MUFP defines a canonical eight-stage sequence through which a federation comes into being. The ordering is normative in intent: meaning, trust, rules and purpose SHALL be agreed *before* any knowledge is exchanged.

1. **Discovery** — participants find one another and read public federation metadata.
2. **Capability Negotiation** — participants agree on supported versions, profiles, imported standards and validation capabilities.
3. **Trust Establishment** — participants establish explicit, evidence-based, multidimensional trust.
4. **Semantic Contract** — participants agree on purpose, scope, permissions, restrictions, disclosure and retention rules.
5. **Schema Discovery** — participants expose and align public semantic structure, vocabularies and mappings.
6. **Projection Exchange** — and only here — purpose-specific Projections of knowledge are exchanged.
7. **Synchronization** — agreed Projections, bindings, mappings, Events and Contracts are kept coherent over time.
8. **Continuous Federation** — the relationship is monitored, reassessed, evolved and, where appropriate, suspended or terminated.

The critical observation is that **data appears only at stage 6**. Stages 1 through 5 establish *meaning, trust, rules and purpose*; only after all four are settled does any knowledge move. Where conventional protocols begin at the equivalent of stage 6 and treat everything before it as someone else's problem, MUFP makes the preceding stages the substance of the protocol.

Implementations MAY optimize, parallelize or revisit stages provided the semantic guarantee holds: no protected knowledge is exchanged before meaning, trust, rules and purpose are agreed. Each stage is served by a dedicated mechanism specified in its own document — see [Federation Lifecycle](Federation-Lifecycle.md) for the full mapping of stages to mechanisms.

The concrete on-the-wire realization of this sequence — the messages, state machine, error taxonomy, version negotiation, revocation and HTTP/JSON binding — is specified in [MUFP Messages](MUFP-Messages.md). That document is what an implementer builds an interoperable endpoint from.

# 7. Discovery

Federation SHOULD begin with public discovery.

A Universe SHOULD expose:

- public metadata;
- supported MUC version;
- supported MMAS version;
- supported MUFP version;
- supported federation profiles;
- available namespaces;
- public schemas.

Discovery SHALL NOT require disclosure of protected instance data.

---

# 8. Capability Negotiation

Participating Universes SHOULD negotiate:

- supported versions;
- supported profiles;
- imported standards;
- semantic mappings;
- validation capabilities.

Negotiation SHALL precede semantic exchange.

---

# 9. Trust

Trust SHALL be explicit.

Trust MAY be established through:

- organizational agreements;
- digital identity;
- signatures;
- certification;
- prior federation history.

Trust SHALL remain traceable.

---

# 10. Semantic Contracts

Every federation SHALL be governed by one or more Semantic Contracts.

Contracts SHALL define:

- purpose;
- scope;
- permissions;
- restrictions;
- disclosure policy;
- retention policy.

Contracts SHALL be versioned.

---

# 11. Projection Exchange

Projection is the preferred exchange unit.

Participating Universes SHALL exchange Projections instead of transferring ownership of Meta-Objects.

Every Projection SHALL preserve:

- canonical identity;
- provenance;
- originating Universe;
- governing Contract.

---

# 12. Version Compatibility

Federation participants SHOULD declare supported versions.

If incompatible versions exist, implementations SHOULD:

- negotiate;
- apply semantic mappings;
- request migration;
- reject federation.

Compatibility SHALL remain explicit.

---

# 13. Traceability

Every federation activity SHALL remain traceable.

Traceability SHOULD include:

- participating Universes;
- exchanged Projections;
- governing Contracts;
- timestamps;
- initiating actors;
- semantic mappings.

---

# 14. Security Principles

Federation SHALL follow these principles:

- least knowledge;
- purpose-driven disclosure;
- explicit authorization;
- schema before data;
- revocable access;
- auditable exchange.

Protected knowledge SHALL NOT be disclosed implicitly.

---

# 15. Failure Handling

Federation failures SHALL preserve:

- constitutional compliance;
- ownership;
- historical traceability.

Partial federation SHALL be preferred over silent inconsistency.

---

# 16. Relationship to Other Standards

MUC defines constitutional rules.

MMAS defines architectural rules.

MUFP defines interaction rules.

All three standards are required for a fully interoperable Meta-Universe ecosystem.

---

# 17. Contrast with Data-Transfer Protocols

MUFP is frequently mistaken for an alternative to REST, GraphQL, gRPC or OData. It is not. Those technologies answer a single question — *"how is data transferred?"* — and answer it well. They are transport and query mechanisms and SHALL be regarded as complementary: a conforming implementation MAY carry MUFP Projection exchanges over any of them.

What those protocols do not address is the matter MUFP exists for:

| Question | REST / GraphQL / gRPC / OData | MUFP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How is data transferred? | Answered | Delegated to transport |
| What does the data *mean*? | Out of scope | Schema Discovery, Semantic Mapping |
| May the data be used at all? | Out of scope | Trust Establishment, Semantic Contract |
| Under which rules, and for what purpose? | Out of scope | Semantic Contract, Consent and Disclosure |
| Who remains authoritative for it? | Out of scope | Identity Binding, sovereignty invariants |

In short, conventional protocols begin where MUFP ends. MUFP is *semantic diplomacy*: the negotiation of meaning, trust, rules and purpose between sovereign semantic spaces. The transfer of data is merely its final, contracted consequence.

---

# 18. Future Directions

MUFP anticipates a richer protocol surface to be elaborated in companion specifications:

- An **Executable Semantic Contract** form, in which the rules of stage 4 are machine-enforceable rather than merely declarative.
- A **Federation of Registries** model, allowing Discovery and Schema Discovery to operate over networks of trust-anchored registries rather than point-to-point exposure.
- A normative **MUFP wire profile** binding the canonical sequence to concrete transports without weakening the stage ordering.

These directions extend MUFP; they do not alter its central premise that meaning, trust, rules and purpose precede data.

---

# Final Statement

MUFP is the constitutional protocol for semantic federation.

Its purpose is to enable independent Universes to collaborate through explicit trust, shared schemas, Semantic Contracts and context-aware Projections while preserving sovereignty, semantic authority and long-term interoperability across the Meta-Universe ecosystem.
