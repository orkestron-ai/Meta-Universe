# 1. Purpose

This document defines Federation Contracts, the normative agreements governing semantic collaboration between sovereign Universes.

A Federation Contract establishes the legal, semantic and operational foundation for exchanging knowledge while preserving sovereignty, identity, ownership and constitutional compliance.

Federation SHALL NOT occur without an applicable Federation Contract unless explicitly permitted by public policy.

---

# 2. Scope

This specification applies to:

- Universe-to-Universe federation;
- Namespace federation;
- Projection exchange;
- Semantic Package exchange;
- delegated authority;
- synchronization activities;
- AI agent collaboration.

---

# 3. Federation Principles

Every Federation Contract SHALL be:

- explicit;
- mutually accepted;
- purpose-driven;
- versioned;
- traceable;
- revocable where applicable;
- technology independent.

Federation Contracts govern cooperation, not ownership.

---

# 3a. The Two-Level Contract Model

A Federation Contract is not a new kind of agreement invented for federation. It is a *specialization* of a more general concept: the **Semantic Contract**, defined in [Contract](../04-core-concepts/Contract.md).

The two levels SHALL be understood as follows:

- **Semantic Contract** — the universal concept. A Semantic Contract states the rules under which knowledge may be used. It is meaningful even *within a single Universe* — for example, governing how one Dimension may project knowledge to another, or how an internal AI agent may consume a Namespace.
- **Federation Contract** — a specialized Semantic Contract that appears *only when two or more sovereign Universes interact*. It carries the additional obligations of cross-Universe cooperation: party identification by canonical identity, version negotiation, mutual trust basis and contractual history that must outlive the federation.

Semantic Contracts therefore form a hierarchy, of which the Federation Contract is one specialization:

```text
Semantic Contract
├── Knowledge Disclosure Contract
├── Projection Contract
├── Delegation Contract
├── Capability Contract
├── Service Contract
└── Federation Contract   (requires ≥ 2 sovereign Universes)
```

MUFP **extends** the base Semantic Contract model; it does not reinvent it. Every requirement stated in this document SHALL be read as an addition to, never a replacement for, the requirements of the Semantic Contract concept. Where this document is silent, the base Semantic Contract rules of [Contract](../04-core-concepts/Contract.md) SHALL apply.

---

# 4. Contract Parties

Every Federation Contract SHALL identify:

- participating Universes;
- governing authorities;
- optional delegated stewards;
- contract owner.

Party identities SHALL use canonical identities.

---

# 5. Purpose

Every Federation Contract SHALL define one or more explicit purposes.

Typical purposes include:

- semantic interoperability;
- operational collaboration;
- regulatory reporting;
- AI reasoning;
- research;
- analytics;
- service delivery.

Knowledge SHALL only be exchanged within declared purposes.

---

# 6. Scope of Federation

The Contract SHALL specify the federation scope, including:

- participating Dimensions;
- participating Namespaces;
- Meta-Models;
- Projection Profiles;
- Semantic Packages;
- synchronization boundaries.

Undefined scope SHALL NOT be assumed.

---

# 7. Knowledge Disclosure

Federation Contracts SHALL define:

- discoverable schemas;
- authorized Projections;
- disclosure policies;
- redaction rules;
- transformation rules;
- retention policies.

Schema discovery MAY be broader than data disclosure.

---

# 8. Trust

Every Federation Contract SHALL define the trust basis.

Trust MAY rely on:

- organizational agreements;
- certification;
- digital signatures;
- legal frameworks;
- prior federation history.

Trust SHALL remain auditable.

---

# 9. Responsibilities

Contracts SHOULD allocate responsibilities including:

- semantic stewardship;
- synchronization;
- incident notification;
- schema evolution;
- compatibility management;
- dispute resolution.

Responsibilities SHALL remain explicit.

---

# 10. Version Compatibility

Contracts SHALL declare supported:

- MUC version;
- MMAS version;
- MUFP version;
- federation profiles;
- imported standards.

Version incompatibilities SHALL be negotiated before semantic exchange.

---

# 11. Lifecycle

Recommended lifecycle:

- Draft
- Proposed
- Active
- Suspended
- Amended
- Expired
- Revoked
- Archived

Lifecycle transitions SHOULD be represented by Events.

---

# 12. Amendment

Contracts MAY evolve through versioned amendments.

Historical versions SHALL remain reconstructable.

Existing obligations SHALL remain traceable.

---

# 13. Federation Termination

Termination SHALL preserve:

- historical traceability;
- audit records;
- identity bindings;
- contractual history.

Termination SHALL NOT invalidate historical semantic exchanges.

---

# 14. Security Principles

Federation Contracts SHALL support:

- least knowledge;
- explicit authorization;
- purpose limitation;
- contract-based disclosure;
- revocable access;
- auditable operations.

Receiving Universes SHALL NOT assume rights beyond those explicitly granted.

---

# 15. Validation

Implementations SHOULD validate:

- participating identities;
- authority;
- declared purpose;
- scope completeness;
- version compatibility;
- trust prerequisites;
- lifecycle state.

Validation SHALL NOT alter published Contracts.

---

# 16. Architectural Invariants

Every Federation Contract SHALL preserve:

- sovereignty;
- canonical identity;
- ownership;
- provenance;
- traceability;
- constitutional compliance.

Federation SHALL exchange semantic knowledge without transferring semantic authority.

---

# 17. Future Directions

Because a Federation Contract is a specialized Semantic Contract, it inherits the trajectory of the base concept. A future **Executable Semantic Contract** form would render the purpose, scope and disclosure rules of a Federation Contract machine-enforceable, so that conformance is checked automatically at projection time rather than asserted in prose. The same hierarchy would allow a library of reusable Federation Contract templates — one per specialization and domain — to be catalogued and versioned without altering the base model.

---

# Final Statement

Federation Contracts are the constitutional agreements that transform trust into interoperable collaboration across the Meta-Universe.

By explicitly defining purpose, scope, responsibilities and disclosure rules, Federation Contracts enable sovereign Universes to cooperate safely while preserving autonomy, semantic authority and long-term interoperability throughout the federation lifecycle.
