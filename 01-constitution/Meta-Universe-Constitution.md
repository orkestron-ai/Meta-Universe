# 1. Purpose

The Meta-Universe Constitution defines the fundamental laws that govern every Meta-Universe, Meta-Model and Federation implementation.

All standards within the Meta-Universe family (including MMAS and MUFP) SHALL conform to this Constitution.

This document defines invariants rather than implementation details.

---

# 2. Scope

This Constitution applies to:

- Meta-Universes
- Meta-Models
- Meta-Objects
- Projections
- Federation
- Semantic Contracts

It is technology independent.

---

# 3. Structure of the Constitution

The Constitution is organized into **chapters**, each grouping related articles, so that it reads as a foundational law rather than a flat sequence of clauses. Articles are numbered continuously across the whole document, so that other standards may cite a stable reference such as *"MUC, Chapter III, Article 11"*.

| Chapter | Title | Articles |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **I** | Fundamental Principles | 1–4 |
| **II** | Semantic Objects | 5–8 |
| **III** | Knowledge Exchange | 9–13 |
| **IV** | Federation | 14–17 |
| **V** | Evolution | 18–19 |
| **VI** | Governance | 20–21 |

# Chapter I. Fundamental Principles

## Article 1. Reality First

Every Meta-Object SHALL represent or intentionally abstract a real or conceptual entity.

Meta-models describe reality; they do not replace reality.

## Article 2. Universal Identity

Every Meta-Object SHALL possess a globally unique and persistent identity.

Identity SHALL remain stable throughout the object's lifetime.

Names, labels and representations MAY change.

## Article 3. Sovereignty

Every Meta-Universe SHALL remain sovereign.

Federation SHALL NOT transfer ownership, governance or identity between universes.

## Article 4. Context

Every semantic fact SHALL exist within an explicit context.

Different contexts MAY legitimately produce different projections of the same object.

Context SHALL be preserved.

---

# Chapter II. Semantic Objects

## Article 5. Separation of Object and Projection

An object and its projections are distinct concepts.

A projection represents an object within a specific context and purpose.

No projection SHALL redefine the identity of its source object.

## Article 6. Ownership

Every significant semantic fact SHALL have an owner.

Ownership determines authority to create, validate, modify and revoke that fact.

Ownership and visibility are independent concepts.

## Article 7. Provenance

Every significant fact SHALL declare its provenance.

Unknown provenance SHALL be explicitly identified.

## Article 8. Traceability

Every significant semantic fact SHALL be traceable.

Implementations SHALL be able to determine:

- origin
- ownership
- evolution
- dependencies

---

# Chapter III. Knowledge Exchange

## Article 9. Shared Schemas

Semantic interoperability SHALL begin with shared schemas.

Public availability of a schema SHALL NOT imply public availability of data.

## Article 10. Semantic Discovery

A Meta-Universe SHALL be able to make the existence and structure of its public schemas discoverable to authorized participants.

Discoverability of a schema SHALL remain independent of access to the underlying data, and SHALL NOT compromise the sovereignty or confidentiality of the publishing universe.

## Article 11. Knowledge Disclosure

Knowledge SHALL be exchanged through explicit contracts.

Disclosure SHALL be limited to the agreed purpose and scope.

## Article 12. Least Knowledge

Every participant SHALL receive only the minimum knowledge required to achieve an agreed purpose.

Implementations SHOULD prefer projections over complete objects.

## Article 13. Purpose

Every request for semantic knowledge SHALL declare its intended purpose.

Purpose SHALL participate in authorization decisions.

---

# Chapter IV. Federation

## Article 14. Trust

Trust SHALL never be assumed.

Trust SHALL be established through verifiable identity, provenance, evidence or agreement.

## Article 15. Security and Confidentiality

Trust SHALL NOT be confused with security.

A Meta-Universe SHALL protect the integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of its semantic facts and of the projections it discloses, independently of the trust established with any participant.

Establishing trust SHALL NOT remove the obligation to secure disclosed knowledge.

## Article 16. Federation

Independent universes SHALL communicate through federation.

Federation SHALL exchange projections rather than ownership.

Synchronization SHALL NOT redefine authority.

## Article 17. Semantic Compatibility

Differences between semantic models SHALL be made explicit through mappings.

Implicit semantic assumptions SHALL be avoided.

---

# Chapter V. Evolution

## Article 18. Evolution

Meta-Universe standards SHALL support long-term evolution.

Breaking semantic changes SHOULD be exceptional and accompanied by migration guidance.

## Article 19. Technology Independence

Constitutional principles SHALL remain independent of programming languages, storage engines, communication protocols and implementation technologies.

---

# Chapter VI. Governance

## Article 20. Constitutional Hierarchy

The Constitution is the highest normative authority within the Meta-Universe standards family.

The hierarchy is:

1. Meta-Universe Constitution (MUC)
2. Meta-Model Architecture Standard (MMAS)
3. Meta-Universe Federation Protocol (MUFP)
4. Domain Meta-Models
5. Concrete Implementations

Lower layers SHALL NOT contradict higher layers.

## Article 21. Conformance

A specification conforms to MUC if it preserves every constitutional article defined in this document.

Additional rules MAY be introduced by subordinate standards, provided they do not violate the Constitution.

Conformance to MUC is a single level: a specification either preserves the constitutional articles or it does not. Maturity levels and federation levels are defined by subordinate standards (see [MMAS-Conformance](../02-architecture/MMAS-Conformance.md) and [MUFP](../03-federation/MUFP.md)), not by the Constitution.

---

# Requirement Identifiers

Every normative statement in this Constitution carries a stable identifier of the form `MUC-Rnn`, catalogued in the [Requirements Index](../REQUIREMENTS-INDEX.md) (for example, `MUC-R03` for Universal Identity, `MUC-R11` for the Object/Projection separation). Subordinate standards, Conformance Statements and [Validation](../02-architecture/Validation.md) reports SHOULD cite these identifiers when referring to a constitutional requirement.

Identifiers are generated from the text by `tools/mu-requirements.ps1` and are assigned in reading order. During the Working Draft phase they MAY shift as the text evolves; they will be frozen at the first stable release.

---

# Final Principle

Meta-Universe is a federation of sovereign semantic universes.

Interoperability is achieved through shared principles, common architecture and explicit contracts rather than centralized ownership of knowledge.
