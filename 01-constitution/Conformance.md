# 1. Purpose

This document defines what it means for a specification, meta-model, federation protocol or implementation to conform to the Meta-Universe Constitution (MUC).

Conformance ensures that independently developed systems preserve the constitutional principles of Meta-Universe while remaining free to evolve within their own domains.

---

# 2. Scope

This document applies to:

- Meta-Models
- Meta-Universe implementations
- Federation protocols
- Domain standards
- Certification processes
- Reference implementations

---

# 3. Definition of Conformance

A specification conforms to MUC if it preserves every constitutional principle defined by the Meta-Universe Constitution.

Conformance does not require identical implementations.

Conformance requires semantic compatibility with the Constitution.

---

# 4. Mandatory Requirements

A conforming specification SHALL:

- preserve the sovereignty of universes;
- preserve globally unique identities;
- distinguish objects from projections;
- preserve context;
- preserve ownership;
- preserve provenance;
- preserve traceability;
- support semantic contracts where applicable;
- avoid implicit semantic assumptions;
- remain technology independent.

Failure to satisfy any mandatory constitutional requirement SHALL result in non-conformance.

---

# 5. Levels of Conformance

The Constitution defines a single constitutional level of conformance.

Additional maturity or capability levels MAY be defined by subordinate standards such as MMAS and MUFP.

These levels SHALL extend, but never weaken, constitutional requirements.

---

# 5a. Conformance Axes

Conformance to the Meta-Universe ecosystem is measured along **three independent axes**, each owned by a different standard:

- **MUC Conformance** — conformance to the constitutional principles defined here. MUC conformance is **single-level**: an artifact either preserves the constitutional principles or it does not. The Constitution defines no maturity tiers.
- **MMAS Conformance** — conformance to the Meta-Model Architecture Standard, expressed as maturity levels (for example, aligned with the validation levels of MMAS).
- **MUFP Conformance** — conformance to the Meta-Universe Federation Protocol, expressed as federation levels.

The axes are independent: an artifact MAY hold constitutional conformance while declaring different levels on the architectural and federation axes. A combined conformance certificate therefore reports one value per axis. For example:

```text
MUC 2.0: Conformant
MMAS:    Level 4
MUFP:    Level 3
```

## Conformance Profiles

A **Conformance Profile** is a named bundle of conformance expectations that an artifact declares it satisfies. Profiles allow an implementation to state, in one place, which axes and capabilities it targets. The following profile dimensions are recognized:

- **MUC** — constitutional conformance.
- **MMAS** — architectural maturity level.
- **MUFP** — federation level.
- **Security** — security guarantees claimed by the artifact.
- **Discovery** — discovery and registry capabilities claimed by the artifact.

A profile makes a multi-axis claim auditable as a single coherent statement while keeping each axis independently verifiable.

---

# 6. Partial Implementations

An implementation MAY support only part of the Meta-Universe ecosystem.

Partial implementations MAY still conform to MUC provided that every implemented feature respects all applicable constitutional principles.

Unsupported features SHALL be explicitly declared.

---

# 7. Extensions

Specifications MAY introduce additional concepts.

Extensions SHALL NOT:

- contradict constitutional principles;
- redefine constitutional terminology;
- weaken constitutional guarantees.

Extensions SHALL declare:

- namespace;
- owner;
- version;
- compatibility statement.

---

# 8. Imported Standards

Meta-Universe encourages the reuse of external semantic standards.

Imported models (for example OData, RDF, Schema.org, BPMN or FHIR) MAY be incorporated into conforming meta-models.

Importing an external standard SHALL NOT exempt the implementation from constitutional obligations.

---

# 9. Certification

Certification processes MAY evaluate conformance.

Certification SHOULD verify:

- semantic consistency;
- constitutional compliance;
- documentation completeness;
- traceability;
- compatibility declarations.

Certification procedures are defined by the corresponding certification authority or ecosystem process.

---

# 10. Declaration of Conformance

Every conforming specification SHOULD publish a Conformance Statement containing at least:

- specification name;
- specification version;
- MUC version;
- conformance status;
- supported extensions;
- known limitations.

Example:

MUC Version: 2.0

Conformance: Yes

Extensions:
- employee/*
- organization/*

Known Limitations:
- Federation Profiles not implemented

---

# 11. Conformance Evolution

Conformance SHALL always reference a specific version of the Constitution.

Future constitutional versions MAY introduce additional requirements.

Conformance SHALL therefore always be version-specific.

---

# 12. Loss of Conformance

A specification SHALL lose constitutional conformance if it:

- violates one or more constitutional articles;
- intentionally redefines constitutional semantics;
- removes mandatory guarantees without constitutional approval.

Loss of conformance SHALL be explicitly documented.

---

# Future Directions

This document defines the constitutional axis (single-level MUC conformance) and names the other two axes, but it does not define their levels. The **MMAS maturity levels** and the **MUFP federation levels** are specified in their own documents. The architectural maturity levels — and their relationship to the V0–V5 validation levels — are defined in [MMAS-Conformance](../02-architecture/MMAS-Conformance.md). A future revision MAY also formalize the Conformance Profile catalogue (MUC, MMAS, MUFP, Security, Discovery) as a registered, machine-readable artifact so that profiles can be discovered and verified automatically.

---

# Final Statement

Conformance to the Meta-Universe Constitution demonstrates semantic compatibility with the constitutional foundation of the Meta-Universe ecosystem.

It does not prescribe implementation details.

It guarantees adherence to a shared set of fundamental semantic laws that enable long-term interoperability between sovereign semantic universes.
