# 1. Purpose

This guide is the **entry point into the Meta-Universe methodology** for architects, developers, domain experts and AI practitioners.

It explains how to begin using the Meta-Universe standards without requiring prior knowledge of the ecosystem, and it opens a guided **learning trajectory** that the rest of `07-guides` continues. The goal of this area is to lower the barrier to entry: `07-guides` is the educational platform of the Meta-Universe, turning a body of standards into something a newcomer can actually start using.

# 1a. Learning Trajectory

Getting Started is the first stop on a path that carries a practitioner from first contact to full participation. Each step has its own guide:

```text
Getting Started
   → Build Your First Meta-Model   (Create-a-New-Meta-Model)
      → Federate Two Meta-Models   (Federation-Guide)
         → Publish to the Registry (Registered-Meta-Models / Repository-Structure)
            → Certification Guide   (Certification)
               → AI Agent Guide     (AI-Agent-Guide)
                  → Migration Guide  (Migration-from-v1)
```

- **Getting Started** — understand what the Meta-Universe is and create a first small model (this guide).
- **Build Your First Meta-Model** — design a real Domain Meta-Model end to end, see [Create a New Meta-Model](Create-a-New-Meta-Model.md).
- **Federate Two Meta-Models** — connect two independent models, see [Federation Guide](Federation-Guide.md).
- **Publish to the Registry** — make the model discoverable, see [Repository Structure](Repository-Structure.md) and [Registered Meta-Models](../06-ecosystem/Registered-Meta-Models.md).
- **Certification Guide** — confirm conformance, see [Certification](../06-ecosystem/Certification.md).
- **AI Agent Guide** — let AI agents reason over the model, see [AI Agent Guide](AI-Agent-Guide.md).
- **Migration Guide** — bring existing repositories forward, see [Migration from v1](Migration-from-v1.md).

A reader can follow the whole trajectory in order, or jump to the step matching the task at hand.

# 2. What is Meta-Universe?

Meta-Universe is an open family of standards for building interoperable semantic ecosystems.

Its foundation consists of:

- Meta-Universe Constitution (MUC)
- Meta-Model Architecture Standard (MMAS)
- Meta-Universe Federation Protocol (MUFP)

Together they define how semantic models are designed, governed and federated.

---

# 3. Recommended Learning Path

Read the specifications in the following order:

1. README.md
2. Vision
3. Principles
4. Meta-Universe Constitution
5. MMAS Core
6. Universe, Object, Projection and Context
7. MUFP
8. Reference Architecture
9. Ecosystem documents
10. Domain Meta-Models

Understanding higher-level concepts first greatly simplifies the remaining documents.

---

# 4. Choose a Domain

Select a domain to model, for example:

- Employee
- Organization
- Product
- Customer
- Software
- AI Agent
- Digital Twin

Start with a small, well-defined domain.

---

# 5. Create Your First Meta-Model

Recommended steps:

1. Define the Namespace.
2. Identify core Objects.
3. Define Relationships.
4. Define Events.
5. Define Projections.
6. Define Contexts.
7. Define Lifecycle.
8. Validate the model.

Model semantic reality before implementation details.

---

# 6. Organize the Repository

Use the recommended repository structure:

- README.md
- 00-foundation
- 01-constitution
- 02-architecture
- 03-federation
- 04-core-concepts
- 05-reference-architecture
- 06-domain-models
- 07-guides
- examples

Consistency improves discoverability and reuse.

---

# 7. Validate

Verify that your model:

- follows MMAS;
- preserves canonical Identity;
- includes traceability;
- defines Context;
- uses Projections;
- follows semantic versioning.

Correct models are easier to federate.

---

# 8. Publish

Publish:

- repository;
- documentation;
- metadata;
- compatibility information;
- validation results.

Publishing makes the model discoverable by humans and AI agents.

---

# 9. Join the Ecosystem

Consider contributing:

- Domain Meta-Models;
- Federation Profiles;
- Semantic Packages;
- Validation tools;
- Reference implementations;
- Documentation.

Community participation strengthens interoperability.

---

# 10. Common Beginner Mistakes

Avoid:

- modeling database tables instead of concepts;
- using local identifiers as canonical identities;
- copying data instead of using Projections;
- omitting Context;
- ignoring provenance.

See Anti-Patterns.md for additional guidance.

---

# 11. Next Steps

After completing your first Meta-Model, explore:

- Federation Patterns;
- Compatibility Matrix;
- Certification;
- Registered Meta-Models;
- Reference Implementations.

Gradually expand from one model to a federated semantic ecosystem.

---

# Final Statement

Getting started with the Meta-Universe begins by understanding semantic concepts rather than implementation technologies.

By following the constitutional principles, architectural standards and federation model defined by MUC, MMAS and MUFP, architects can create reusable Meta-Models that evolve consistently, interoperate across organizations and serve as a foundation for AI-native systems and long-term semantic collaboration.
