# 1. Purpose

This guide explains a recommended process for designing a new Domain Meta-Model that conforms to the Meta-Universe standards.

It focuses on semantic design rather than implementation technology and provides a repeatable workflow suitable for both human architects and AI agents.

---

# 2. Before You Begin

Become familiar with:

- Meta-Universe Constitution (MUC)
- Meta-Model Architecture Standard (MMAS)
- Meta-Universe Federation Protocol (MUFP)
- Core Concepts

A Meta-Model extends the existing ecosystem rather than redefining it.

---

# 2a. The Meta-Model Lifecycle

A Meta-Model is not created in a single act of authoring. It follows a natural **lifecycle** that begins before the first concept is written and continues long after publication:

```text
Need → Domain Definition → Search Existing Models → Reuse Existing Concepts
     → Design New Concepts → Validate → Prepare Federation → Publish
     → Register → Certify → Federate → Evolve
```

- **Need** — a real problem creates the reason to model;
- **Domain Definition** — the boundaries and purpose are made explicit;
- **Search Existing Models** — the ecosystem is checked for what already exists;
- **Reuse Existing Concepts** — compatible concepts are imported, extended or mapped;
- **Design New Concepts** — only the genuinely missing parts are created;
- **Validate** — the model is checked against MUC and MMAS;
- **Prepare Federation** — mappings, identity bindings and profiles are readied;
- **Publish** — the model is released with documentation and metadata;
- **Register** — it is listed for discovery, see [Registered Meta-Models](../06-ecosystem/Registered-Meta-Models.md);
- **Certify** — conformance is confirmed, see [Certification](../06-ecosystem/Certification.md);
- **Federate** — it connects with other Universes, see [Federation Guide](Federation-Guide.md);
- **Evolve** — it changes over time while preserving identity and history.

The numbered steps below realize the middle of this lifecycle in detail. The key point is that *Search* and *Reuse* come **before** any *Design*.

## 2a.1 Reuse before Create

The governing principle of the lifecycle is **Reuse before Create**. Before creating any new Object, Namespace or Meta-Model, look for a compatible solution that can be *imported*, *extended* or *mapped*. Creating a new concept is the last resort, not the first move — every redundant concept the ecosystem accumulates is a future mapping, a future conflict and a barrier to federation. Reuse keeps the shared semantic space coherent.

---

# 3. Step 1 — Define the Domain

Clearly identify:

- business domain;
- purpose;
- boundaries;
- stakeholders;
- expected federation scenarios.

Prefer one coherent domain over a broad universal model.

---

# 4. Step 2 — Search Existing Models

Before creating anything new:

- review Registered Meta-Models;
- check imported standards;
- evaluate reusable Semantic Packages;
- identify possible Federation Profiles.

Reuse before creating.

---

# 5. Step 3 — Define the Namespace

Create a stable namespace representing the domain.

Examples:

- employee
- organization
- product
- ai-agent

Namespaces are kept short, unique and semantically meaningful.

---

# 6. Step 4 — Identify Core Objects

Determine the authoritative business concepts.

Example:

Employee Meta-Model

- Employee
- Position
- Skill
- Employment
- Performance Review

Objects represent semantic entities rather than database tables.

---

# 7. Step 5 — Define Relationships

Model semantic relationships such as:

- reportsTo
- belongsTo
- assignedTo
- owns
- dependsOn

Relationships have explicit meaning.

---

# 8. Step 6 — Define Events

Identify meaningful lifecycle events.

Examples:

- EmployeeHired
- EmployeePromoted
- PositionChanged
- EmployeeTerminated

Events describe completed business occurrences.

---

# 9. Step 7 — Define Projections

Create context-specific views.

Illustrative examples:

- Public Projection
- HR Projection
- Payroll Projection
- AI Projection
- Partner Projection

Every Projection references the same canonical Identity.

---

# 10. Step 8 — Define Context

Specify the contexts in which information is interpreted.

Context explains:

- audience;
- purpose;
- visibility;
- assumptions.

Context is essential for semantic correctness.

---

# 11. Step 9 — Define Lifecycle

Describe how core Objects evolve.

Typical phases:

- Created
- Active
- Updated
- Archived
- Retired

Lifecycle transitions generate Events.

---

# 12. Step 10 — Prepare Federation

Identify:

- external standards;
- Semantic Mappings;
- Identity Bindings;
- Federation Profiles;
- synchronization requirements.

Federation is considered from the beginning.

---

# 13. Step 11 — Validate

Review the Meta-Model for:

- MUC compliance;
- MMAS compliance;
- traceability;
- naming consistency;
- versioning;
- Projection design;
- Context completeness.

Automated validation is recommended.

---

# 14. Step 12 — Publish

Publish:

- repository;
- documentation;
- metadata;
- examples;
- schemas (optional);
- compatibility information.

Version the Meta-Model using Semantic Versioning.

---

# 15. Common Mistakes

Avoid:

- mixing multiple domains;
- modeling implementation details;
- copying existing standards unnecessarily;
- omitting Context;
- omitting Projections;
- using local identifiers as canonical identities.

Refer to Anti-Patterns.md for detailed guidance.

---

# 16. Design Checklist

Before release verify:

- Domain boundaries are clear.
- Namespace is stable.
- Objects are semantic.
- Relationships are explicit.
- Events are complete.
- Context is defined.
- Projections are designed.
- Lifecycle is documented.
- Federation is considered.
- Validation passes.

---

# Final Statement

Creating a Meta-Model is the process of modeling semantic reality, not software implementation.

By following the constitutional principles of MUC, the architectural rules of MMAS and the federation capabilities of MUFP, authors can build reusable Domain Meta-Models that remain understandable, interoperable and evolvable across organizations, AI agents and future generations of semantic systems.
