# 1. Purpose

This guide explains how to migrate existing Meta-Universe v1.x repositories and Meta-Models to the Meta-Universe v2 architecture.

The migration preserves historical knowledge while aligning repositories with the constitutional, architectural and federation principles introduced in v2.

Migration is evolutionary rather than disruptive.

# 1a. Three Levels of Migration

Migration is not a single operation. It happens at **three distinct levels**, which can progress at different speeds and be reasoned about independently:

- **Structural Migration** — the *repository and document structure*: folder layout, file organization, document identifiers and headers. This is the most visible and the easiest to automate.
- **Semantic Migration** — the *terminology, concepts, relationships and rules*: how a Galaxy becomes a Namespace, how an Object becomes a Meta-Object, how meanings are preserved as names change. This is the substance of the migration.
- **Federation Migration** — *how the model interacts with other Universes*: adopting Trust, Identity Binding, Semantic Mappings, Contracts and Projection Synchronization so the migrated model can participate in the wider ecosystem.

Structural migration moves the files; semantic migration preserves the meaning inside them; federation migration restores how the model relates to others. A complete migration addresses all three.

## 1a.1 Migration Invariants

Regardless of level, migration:

- is **traceable** — every change can be followed from its source to its result;
- is **reversibly explainable** — the rationale and prior state are recorded, so a change can be understood and, where needed, reversed;
- **preserves historical continuity** — past versions and Events remain available;
- **does not break Canonical Identity** — identities survive the move unchanged;
- **does not change meaning silently** — any change of meaning is recorded as an explicit migration Event, never as an unannounced side effect of restructuring.

The last invariant is the most important: structural change is allowed to be quiet, but semantic change is not. Meaning only changes through a declared migration event.

# 2. Migration Philosophy

Migration is expected to:

- preserve historical traceability;
- avoid semantic loss;
- minimize breaking changes;
- introduce new concepts incrementally;
- preserve canonical identities.

History remains part of the repository.

---

# 3. Major Changes in v2

Version 2 introduces:

- Meta-Universe Constitution (MUC);
- Meta-Model Architecture Standard (MMAS);
- Meta-Universe Federation Protocol (MUFP);
- Reference Architecture;
- Ecosystem specifications;
- standardized repository organization.

These additions extend rather than replace previous concepts.

---

# 4. Repository Migration

Recommended migration:

1. Archive the existing v1 repository structure.
2. Create the v2 directory layout.
3. Move historical documents into `archive/v1/`.
4. Introduce new foundation documents.
5. Add constitutional specifications.
6. Add architecture specifications.
7. Add federation specifications.
8. Validate repository consistency.

Historical releases remain available.

---

# 5. Concept Mapping

Typical concept evolution:

- Galaxy → Namespace
- Meta-Universe → Universe
- Existing Object → Meta-Object
- Existing Projection → Projection (unchanged)
- Existing Identity → Canonical Identity

Concept evolution preserves semantic intent.

---

# 6. Namespace Migration

Namespaces become first-class architectural elements.

Existing identifiers can remain unchanged where compatible.

Namespace ownership becomes explicit.

---

# 7. Repository Structure Migration

Existing documentation is reorganized into:

- 00-foundation
- 01-constitution
- 02-architecture
- 03-federation
- 04-core-concepts
- 05-reference-architecture
- 06-ecosystem
- 07-guides

Reorganization preserves document history.

---

# 8. Federation Migration

Repositories adopt MUFP concepts including:

- Trust Model;
- Identity Binding;
- Semantic Mapping;
- Federation Contracts;
- Projection Synchronization.

Federation can be introduced gradually.

---

# 9. Validation

After migration verify:

- repository organization;
- document identifiers;
- terminology consistency;
- naming conventions;
- cross-document references;
- version metadata.

Validation is automated whenever practical.

---

# 10. Backward Compatibility

Meta-Universe v2 is designed to preserve compatibility with v1 concepts wherever practical.

Historical terminology can remain within archived documents.

Current documents use v2 terminology.

---

# 11. Recommended Migration Workflow

Suggested sequence:

1. Archive
2. Reorganize
3. Rename concepts
4. Introduce MUC
5. Introduce MMAS
6. Introduce MUFP
7. Add Reference Architecture
8. Add Ecosystem
9. Validate
10. Publish

Every stage remains traceable.

---

# 12. Common Migration Challenges

Typical issues include:

- duplicated terminology;
- inconsistent identities;
- missing traceability;
- technology-oriented descriptions;
- mixed domain boundaries.

Migration prioritizes semantic consistency over document layout.

---

# 13. Migration Checklist

Before publishing verify:

- Archive is complete.
- Repository follows v2 structure.
- Terminology is updated.
- Namespace replaces Galaxy where applicable.
- References are valid.
- Validation passes.
- History is preserved.

---

# 14. Future Evolution

Repositories migrated to v2 are ready for:

- Registry publication;
- Compatibility Matrix generation;
- Certification;
- Federation Profiles;
- AI-assisted validation.

Migration prepares repositories for long-term ecosystem participation.

---

# 15. Future Directions

The semantic level of migration would benefit from a dedicated **Semantic Migration Standard (SMS)**. SMS would formalize how meaning is carried across versions: a vocabulary of migration Events, machine-readable mappings from old concepts to new ones, traceability and reversibility guarantees, and conformance rules ensuring that no meaning changes without an explicit, recorded migration event. With SMS in place, structural and semantic migration could be validated and even partly automated while keeping Canonical Identity and historical continuity intact across an entire Universe.

# Final Statement

Migration to Meta-Universe v2 is an architectural evolution rather than a rewrite.

By preserving historical knowledge while adopting constitutional governance, standardized architecture and semantic federation, organizations can modernize existing repositories with minimal disruption and position them for long-term interoperability across the growing Meta-Universe ecosystem.
